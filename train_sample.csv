"__label__1 Expensive Junk: This product consists of a piece of thin flexible insulating material, adhesive backed velcro and white electrical tape.Problems:1. Instructions are three pictures with little more information.2. Velcro was all crumpled as received and was stronger than the adhesive. When i tried to disengage the velcro both pieces came off and the paint from the ceiling.3. White electrical tape was horrible... cheap, narrow and it fell off in less than 1 hour.4. The price is a ripoff.I am building my own which is easier to use, cheaper, more attractive, and higher r-value. I am surprised Amazon even lists this junk.",
"__label__1 Toast too dark: Even on the lowest setting, the toast is too dark for my liking. Also, the on light stays lit so you have to unplug it to avoid wasting electricity. Not the quality I expected from Cuisinart.",
__label__2 Excellent imagery...dumbed down story: I enjoyed this disc. The video is stunning. I agree with others that the story is very dumbed down and takes a childish approach. It actually seems like its a little one sided and VERY pro-environmental. Nevertheless its enjoyable. I would say however that the Amazon WMV HD disc is a better story and has better and sharper images and more interesting things to look at.,
"__label__1 Are we pretending everyone is married?: The authors pretend that parents neither die nor divorce. Insisting the marriage is the rock upon which all else (behavior, well-being of the child) is built, they send a clear message to non-traditional households: this book is for people who play the game of life our way only, and everyone else can suffer the bad behavior they deserve to.",
"__label__1 Not worth your time: Might as well just use a knife, this product holds next to nothing. I found it to be a useless product.",
"__label__1 Book reads like written for grade schoolers: I think that the whole aspect of hitting the road and going on tour with a band is just about the coolest thing that a person can do. Thus, this book seemed like the perfect read for someone like me. But when I got the book I was dissapointed in the fact that it seems like the author took five or six stories from the 'The Babysiters Club' or some other book for young kids, rewrote them to include drug and music references, and than sold it. The writing is just not very good and the stories are all lame. A girl's mother realizes her 16 year old daughter is right about being on tour, a girl runs from the cops and gets away, a ticket is fake, ect. Those in themselves aren't even that bad but the way he writes makes it a boring read.",
"__label__1 Jeanne de Florette & Manon of the Springs: I saw these movies originally in the theater, loved both and ordered them because I wanted to have it in my collection. I ordered it twice and neither of the DVDs worked. I would think you would check your merchandise before sending it out. I am so disappointed and can't believe that you could send out two defective DVDs and had not solved the problem after the first one plus some of the complaints I have read in the reviews. I am rating this with one star because of the quality of the DVD, not the films.Colleen",
"__label__1 Theater Projector Ceiling Mount: Would not fit my new Optima HD20 projector -- as projectors get smaller the mounting holes get closer together -- this mount had four arms and the projector had three -- the mount had arms that would not get short enough to reach the three projector holes -- for larger projectors may work better, but for mine would not recommend -- returning it was very easy and the company representatives very helpful -- so if you get it and it doesn't work, the company is easy to work with --",
"__label__2 This import is sooooooooooo good: This is a great cd!!!!!!!!! It is the normal oops! cd plus three cool new songs. Also there are lots of added extras that are inhansed on the cd, for example you get the lucky video, a fact file, and a britney unscrambler!!!!! The three bonus tracks are really nice but I wish that they could have been a little more up tempo. Just to clear something up it says in the discription that there is an exclusive oops preformance but there isn't!",
"__label__1 Garbage: The handle broke clean off after TWO WEEKS. Not the plastic part, actually at the weld where the metal meets the pan. Wasn't overheated, wasn't abused, used 4 times and broke.",
"__label__2 Amazing, Fascinating: This was a stunning book. Well written, packed with fascinating detail, I wish I had ten more like it to turn to. Anyone looking for an inside view of a part of China's history would do well to pick up this book. It was a wonderful read.",
"__label__1 Not great: This book just gives you the basics unfortunately. Was not very helpful, I would suggest just doing research on the interweb instead.",
__label__1 superficial fluff: This book does not convey much of anything. Save your time and money. Read Searching for Bobby Fischer. The details and honesty are lacking in this made for MTV summary of kindergartener makes good.,
"__label__2 Great Album - some serious stuff: First off, I've bought ALL of Tonis other albums. This one took me three listenings to really get to like it. When I found out that it was about a child being born and how her life progressed, I found the work all the more interesting. Some of the songs really stick in your mind. If you see the Album as a story (of a girls life) it makes the Album much more interesting than just listening to the album song by song.Pink Floyd used to do this, have an album which was a theme or story, like The Wall album.I took the CD out of my colection after not listening to it for about 5 months, and have been playing it in my car on the way to work and home for over a week now.It's GREAT. And I'm not a female by the way.Nice ALbum. If you like Tonis other works,.....GET IT.",
"__label__2 good quality, but high shipping charge: the scratch resistant screen guard protector is fit perfectly on the screen of HTC cingular 8125. Quality of the screen guard protector is very good. only negative point is high shipping charge. it cost me $4.99 as shipping for buying this item which cost $ 3.49 amazon has to reduce the shipping charge, or reduce the shipping charge for combined items. any way best buy.",
__label__1 Couldn't even finish it.: I couldn't even finish the book. I got about half way through and realized I wasn't paying attention and didn't care. Nothing like Harry Potter - not fun at all. I can't recommend this at all!,
__label__2 Great choice for bedtime or anytime!: We were given this book as a shower gift before our kids were born and I was somewhat skeptical but it has turned out to be a favorite. Our daughter loves to name the animals and their sounds and has learned her colours from these wonderful books. The pictures are just right as is the wonderful text that is just enough repetition that she 'gets it' to participate with the reading. A great asset to your children's library... or shower gift for those people who have everything already!,
"__label__2 Fun for all ages!: Having received this video as a gift, we watched it as a family, accompanied by a lot of laughter and ""I didn't know that"". The kids managed to show this to most of their friends, the youngest even taking it to school where his 1st grade teacher used it as a part of her unit on Careers.The video is an overall winner. Anyone, any age, will enjoy the playful and informative story and all will come away with a greater understanding and respect for both the lobster and the lobsterman. BUY IT!",
__label__2 Contemplating Marriage...a must read.: This book is used by many marriage counselors. But I believe if you are getting married this book should be required reading. It provides true insight to what makes us tick and how to keep the fire burning bright which should be every expecting to be couple's heart desire.,
"__label__2 Ran the Stoplight?: Listened to this CD closely for the first time in a while. I've forgotten how outstanding this CD is. While I have not heard Pure, I have ordered it hoping it that will be anything close to this CD - and hopefully far away from Dead Inside which is a whole different planet. Great vocals, great music, great lyrics, it has it all.",
"__label__2 Excelente Compilaci√≥n de lo mejor de Caifanes: Debido a los otros comentarios al respecto de este disco quiero aclarar que Caifanes NO es lo mismo que Jaguares. Son dos grupos diferentes ya que en Caifanes la guitarra estaba en primer plano. El unico pero que le pongo a este CD es que solo incluyeron 2 canciones del MTV Unplugged. Me hubiera gustado que incluyeran todo el MTV unplugged en el segundo disco. Las guitarras de Marcovich se aprecian mas en las versiones en vivo ya que existe la certeza de que no hay ""overdubbing"" (Regrabaciones). Un buen disco para empezar. Estoy seguro que si este es el primer disco de Caifanes que se adquiere pronto nacera la curiosidad por conocer las canciones que no se incluyen de los otros discos.",
__label__1 Not prepared as an ebook: This book has two stories writen at the same time. In the original pbook format one story was written in left pages and the other in the right pages. But this is all lost in the Kindle and its very complicated to follow the story. I can not uderestand how they dare to sell a product not propared to be used properlly by its readers.,
"__label__1 Thanks for the 1960s home movie Ken Burns: The documentary is typical Ken Burns... interesting, but a little meandering at times.The real shame of this version is the grainy video that is painfully apparent on a large HD display. Burns' panned still images are crystal clear showing every blemish and fold of the old photographs but his shots of the majestic scenery in the parks are marred by his poor choice of camera and film. I will say the soundtrack is fairly well done even if Peter Coyote (narrator) is a little dry.Do not bother with the blu ray version, you will not get anything more than the standard DVD version with this series.",
"__label__1 not nearly as good as the first series: This book is nowhere near as good as the the first series! It SERIOSLY LACKS EXEMENT!In other words don't buy it, if you really want to read it, get it from the libray. I would not recomend it to anybody.",
"__label__2 HARRISON FORD AT HIS VERY BEST! WITNESS RULES!: ""WITNESS"" is about Ford and an Amish boy who witnesses a murder. Now, the Amish don't beleive in killing and guns - and to have their child see that sort of stuff is just terrible. Now, men who were involved in the murder are out to murder THE AMISH BOY! Suspenseful and red - blooded, ""WITNESS"" is an awsome film! I loved it and I bet anyone will, too! ENJOY!",
"__label__2 Excellently Drawn Characters: Nina's characters are complex and drawn well, it is evident that she took some time to think about her character's motivations. If I were a writer I might have written the ending differently, but that is okay, my book club talked about this one for awhile. A good exploration of the line between admiring someone and stalking and a bold exploration of the dark side of behavior. If you are looked for a well plotted, interesting story, this is for you. It is not one of those books with lots of sex and no plot as you might think at first. I was pleasantly surprised and look forward to whatever Ms. Foxx has up her sleeve next.",
__label__2 it's nice: I've saved a lot of space by hanging my shoes up with this. For heavier shoes you have to use more than one hanger though,
"__label__2 One of the best albums I've owned.: A few years back my father got me hooked on this album. It was the first cd I ever owned. An ex-girlfriend liked it so much that after we broke up she declared that cd was not coming with me.I couldn't blame her. The mix of blues and spirituals with Cooder's unique playing makes this one the most intesting albums I own. The medley of ""Feeling Good"" and ""Fool for a Cigarette"" is one of my favorites as well as balads like ""Mexican Divorce"" and ""Jesus on the Main Line"".The album also has some songs that keep it from taking itself too seriously. The song ""If Walls Could Talk"" has a catchy riff and great words.Cooder's great acoustic style shines through on what was a break-through album of the time and holds up years later. I always hear something that I missed on previous listenings.Although you don't need to be a guitar player to appreciate this album, every acoustic player should hear the fine guitar work. Enjoy!",
__label__2 Great for making dough: I ordered this bread machine for a vacation home that we own. I have a Cuisinart at my year-round home and it just has too many bells and whistles that I never use - and cost a lot more. The Sunbeam makes a great dough and was a great price.,
"__label__1 Mac Owners Beware: My wife purchased a Rocket ebook for me for Christmas. She started here at Amazon. She carefully checked the Rocket web site as well, and spoke to the folks that make the Rocket. She was assured that everything required to use the Rocket with a Mac was included. Wrong! Any Mac currently being made or made during the past year or so requires a Keyspan connector between the e-book and the Mac USB slot. This costs $80. It is not mentioned in any documentation that comes with the ebook. It took me more than an hour to get through to the company. At first they responded by saying it was at their Website and/or in the FAQ section, but we ""went to their Web site together"" while I was on the phone, and they reluctantly conceded that they had mislead the public. The company does literature. Guide provided on the ebook. Regardless of how much I may eventually enjoy this toy, I'll never develop a high regard for NuvoMedia, which makes the Rocket ebook.",
"__label__1 a disaster one month at a time: Upon receipt it was dead, after a mixture of e-mailes and phone calls it was determined I needed to use 2 USB cables to power the drive. Since I only have 2 on my laptop, I cant print from the drive. after transfering 10 gig of pictures and 13 gig of mp3's the unit failed the next month. Again emails and phone calls determined my laptop did not have enough power to run the drive. The solution was an AC adapter.....great for a ""portable USB drive"" They said an AC adaptor would be sent...no adapter after 4 weeks now. I tried the drive on 4 other DESKTOPS, plenty of USB power, but no luck. I have lost so much information, pictures, and music and now no emails refering to my ""service number"" are being answered at all.A total lack of customer servive AND knolage of their own product. Think long and hard before dealing with Iogear!!",
"__label__1 Junk: I just got my DVD in today and I tried to watch it but there seems to be nothing on both discs, I have tried it in my DVD player and my computer, nothing is on both discs, nothing will load, I got robbed.If there were something on both discs, i'd give it a high rating, but for now, all i'll give is one star.",
__label__2 It is fun and a nice car: It is a nice car - better than a already made car - your son will have fun assemble it will even do some changes and when he finish he can continue playing as if it were a standard car.,
"__label__1 Robbery: This is a horrible disc, all of the songs, save one or two, have been reworked. If your looking for a cd to hear bygone favorites, as they were originally done, this is not the disc.",
__label__2 Definitely works: Have used this and it definitely gets u going to the potty!! Bye bye water weight! I just don't like that it has to steep for a while...I am impatient.,
__label__2 Excellent: All of James Patterson's books (Women's Murder Club) have kept me in suspense. I would be glad to say that it have been a thrill to read them,
__label__2 Everyone needs to let it go!: I'm sick of everyone saying Ashlee has no talent. If she had no talent she wouldn't have a record deal. She is only 19 and talks about 19 year old things. People seem to forget that she has been on tv for 2 years and that is why people already know her. I appreciate her music b/c it is her music. She's more than many musicians today-she's writing the lyrics rather than singing other people's songs. The album is good. Quit putting her down and appreciate her for her hard work! She sings a lot better than other musicians you all like!,
"__label__1 Not even ok.: I'm a pilot, and I'm giving up on this product. I've been trying to use it, calibrate it, get it to respond somewhat close to the way a real aircraft responds, and it just doesn't work. It is possible I'm doing something wrong, but it should not take several hours of trying to figure out the right way. I've reduced sensitivity to zero and it still won't respond realistically.",
"__label__1 One Minute to Zero: Movie had a great story, but filming methods of that time was not that great. I enjoyed the movie mostly because I had met the stars when they were in Colorado Springs during the filming of some of the movie.I purchased this movie from Amazon.",
__label__2 Just like when I was a kid!: I bought this for my daughter when she was almost 2yrs. and she loved it from the start. The music is a little annoying but that is my problem not hers. She has stood on top of it and it has been dropped down the stairs and it still works fine!I would definalty reccomend this toy!,
__label__1 Disappointed:: I was disappointed with this book. Since it said Hallelujah on the cover I though it was raw food recipes. I will be giving it away for a gift when I need something for a gift the next time.This book should of never been put with the Hallelujah diet book.,
"__label__1 This Muse is a slumber!: Actually, I thought I had ordered the CD of the TV show. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Amazom staff admitted that the pics on the sell page were misleading. We've listened and it's not worth much. Curious how a TV sound track can be so engaging and another CD so trite and shallow. Buyer beware.",
"__label__1 Not necessary.: I bought this neck strap WITH my camera, thinking I would be insane not to have a strap to put around my neck.I learned, however, that it really isn't necessary. The Elphs are so tiny that they EASILY fit into your pocket. The other option is to wind the included wrist strap around your wrist. They're so lightweight that you barely notice they're there.",
"__label__1 Men with Brooms: If you love the sport of curling, do not watch this movie! The acting is just okay. Don't let your kids watch this movie as there is a lot of profanity in it. The movie isn't awful, but it isn't good either. The curling action is not realistic.",
"__label__2 Works great for me: After my last Panasonic Shaver mysteriously disappeared when I moved across the country, I decided to try this one, since the price was so cheap I wouldn't be kicking myself if the other shaver is rediscovered in a moving box somewhere. I have been very pleased with it, and love shaving in the shower with it. Like others, I have found that the neck area requires a little more attention and a few extra passes to get the job done, but well worth it for a close shave with no bleeding. It took over a month for the product to be delivered from Amazon, since they were out of stock when I ordered.",
"__label__1 Item doen't work: This UPS never worked from day one when I pluged it up.The lcd display only comes on when it's working off the battery,and I cant get it to charge the battery because it seems like its not seeing the power source it just doesn't work.",
"__label__1 Not for burning: Within 20 minutes these candles were completely melted and now my carpet is a mess. More for decoration and with that being the case, these candles are too expensive for what your getting.",
"__label__2 Lost: A friend gave me a copy of ""Dresden"" and I watched it many times before giving it back and ordering my own copy. I watched the movie several times for different reasons: 1. History, 2. View from the German side, 3. View from the British side, 4. Acting skills. I love the movie, am impressed with F. Woll's in the main role. I think some scenes were too Hollywood, loved the honesty of the script, not too much violence, but one can start to feel the horror of the bombings and being trapped in cellars and on the ground by the devastating fires. I was a mistake, a big one, History was destroyed as it often is in wars. Did the Germans deserve this so much emotionally human reaction? Yes and No. Not only the Germans or the people of Dresden lost a jewel.",
"__label__1 LAME: I agree with the kids review below. This album along with all of their others is garbage. They just keep putting out the same album over and over.Do you really think in 10, 20, even 30 years, people are going to be playing Nickelback CDs and saying, ""Wow they were a great band""? Who goes around blasting Creed, Poison, Cinderella, Ratt, or C&C; Music Factory? This band will be forgotten just like these others.It's textbook rock ballad garbage with no thought or feeling put into the song writing. They have found a formula that somehow sells records and so they've stuck with it. Watch their live performances with Chad's gay permed haircut. Someone should take their instruments away so they won't poison rock music anymore.",
"__label__2 Great movie!: This is the epitome of a ""B"" western movie, but it's hilarious! Andy Griffith, Tom Berrenger, Marilou Henner and Selma Ward--all of them did a great job on this!",
"__label__2 Yummy!: These are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. They have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. The fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. Very few of these were broken during shipping. I definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. They are a low-calorie, low-fat snack. Yummy!",
"__label__2 Great speaker package for the money!: Polk Audio RM6750 5.1 Channel Home Theater Speaker System, Black FinishI have been using this speaker system for about a year with a Sony STR-DG810. I am very pleased with the performance of this package especially at the price point. My friends and family have all been impressed remarking that the system sounds like a movie theater. Bass from sub-woofer is deep and powerful and the center speaker reproduces dialoge beautifully. What is also nice, Polk sells seperate surround speakers so I can make a 6.1 system since my Sony receiver has that capability. Don't worry if you are thinking about RM6750, I have enjoyed mine from the start!",
"__label__1 misleading specs: VA 1/2 inch rotaty files and rasps are not 1/2 inch in diameter. They can be up to 1/16 smaller depending on product number. ie: 16671 is labeled 12.7 mm, yet VA's spec is 12.0 mm, and 16674 is labeled 12.7 mm, yet VA's spec is 11.6 mm",
"__label__2 kfm: I first saw Kentucky Fried Movie when I was 17 years old. I am now 51. A friend of mine mentioned a line from the movie and it was so funny that I went online to buy this movie to show my son and also to see it again with my friends now. It is made up of little skits that are all funny. Maybe a little silly also, but still a good movie to hang out and watch.",
"__label__2 Funkin amazing and out there: Like Strayhorn and the Duke, Gil really found someone he could bounce off in the shape of Brian Jackson. His earlier stuff is pure gold, but very droney sometimes... BUT THIS!!!This I never tire of. The songs still sound so vibrant and fresh.The live version of 'home is where the hatred is' has been sampled by masters @ work, and is a muso's dream to get into.'Hello Sunday hello road is one of the grooviest tracks around, and you just can fail to move along and understand the message of 'It's your world.' My Mum used to have the LP, Secrets, with the cats face on the cover. Angel dust is a spacey reincarnation of whats it's like to trip out on the stuff, and the lyrics to showbusiness are more relevent today than ever before.This is one of the best and most valuble compilations of Gils to come out, and is an essential purchase for and funkster and poet.",
"__label__2 Great Art, Great Action: Jedis are great and all, but I really enjoy the war aspect of this series. Vol 1 was good, Vol 2 started really picking up in the last section, and Vol 3 really gets to it--War! Its the volumes like this one that make me wish they had a series devoted to Clone Troopers, Republic Commandos, and ARCs (esp Alpha). Good inking and artwork. Straight-forward plot, almost near constant action, and it was good to see the Republic actually defeated here. Nice character development for Anakin. This volume has been my favorite so far...looking forward to getting Vol 4.",
"__label__1 Good for stretching, not to get a workout.: I've been to yoga classes where you get more of a workout than this one. This is more like a stretching exercise. My complaint is a lot of the stretches seemed to repeat many times. The equipment required for use to follow the exercise like the block, straps are kinda specialised items you'd have to buy. I tried to substitue with items I can find at home like a step stool, and rope.For a real workout, I prefer the Perfect Pregnancy workout dvd with Karyne Steben.",
"__label__1 TERRIBLE ACTING: This movie could have been good, but the acting was SO bad I turned it off after 20 minutes (I can't even believe I watched it that long) I was hoping something would change, the plot was a good, but COULD not even get into any of the characters. I don't recommend this movie.",
__label__2 out standing: this item make's my bathroom look like you don't want to leave the room.i wish there were other item's to match the seat. thank you!,
"__label__2 Amazing first single!!!: The first single from this album is called ""Through the Rain"". It's like Old Mariah only even better. This is a beautiful ballad which has a similiar theme to ""Hero"" or ""Can't Take That Away"", but is even more incredible. If you liked ""old"" mariah, you will want this album. She does have rappers on it, but they aren't the main focus. It's such a beatiful song and I have heard soooooooooo many good things about this album ~ and not just from fans but from critics too! Go to her official site to listen to Through the Rain http://www.mariahcarey.com",
"__label__1 Awkward and trite, too many cliches for me.: While the subject matter of ""The Last Dive"" is compeling enough to carry its own story line, the author's attempts to interject contrived dialogue is embarrasing and a deteriment to his otherwise skillfull writing. Chowdhury would have been well advised to simply tell the story and not try to animate it with guessed-at dialogue. I came away disliking the ""cowboy-like"" father and son diving team and their tragic demise came as no surprise. Chowdhury's techincal explanations and descrption of the history of the sport are very good. Unfortunately his fictionalizing of the varous conversations is more cartoon than clever.",
"__label__1 What a Pervert!: This was a horrible book!Anthony is a sadistic pedophiliac who had been ""watching [the heroine] from afar"". He had even gone so far as to have her tutored in a language he wanted her to speak.It sickened me that the character was made to fall in love with her rapist.""Love"" does not justify rape or whipping a woman or any of the other sick things in this book.",
"__label__1 Mitusmi Extrenal USB Floppy Drive: The unit itself seems to be a good unit. However... it is a terrible device for using in Windows 7 Pro. There are no drivers for it, and you can't not get customer support to answers to your correspondence, for it. So if your going to try to use it in Windows 7... for now, for get it.",
"__label__2 My dog's favorite toy by far!: I bought the duck for my 5 pound poodle and it became his favorite toy. The sound of the duck scared him though, but the great part is if they don't like it you can just remove it and they still love just the plush toy. It's perfect for even the smallest dogs and can easily be carried around and played with. The design makes it easy for small dogs to get their mouths around to pick up. I would not recommend this for very destructive dogs though as the limbs might get torn off.",
"__label__1 Romantic Rape?: I enjoy romance novels. I do not enjoy reading about a woman who is abducted, continually raped, impregnated, and then FALLS IN LOVE with her rapist. I kept reading hoping that he would get his just dessert. But he didn't. She falls in love with him and he gets ""reformed."" ????? The whole time all I could think was--this is called Stockholm Syndrome! I was horrified that this was considered a romance. The rape scenes were graphic and, in many cases, violent.Johanna Lindsey should be ashamed of herself for making rape romantic. It is horrible. DO NOT READ!!!",
"__label__1 Did not live up to the hype; not even close.: I really was disappointed in this book. With all the hype I expected it to be filled with revolutionary ideas and recipes for totally green smoothies. There are a few interesting details such as the thought that our diet should more closely resemble chimps. Basically we should eat more greens. Other than that much of it is hard to believe. There is absolutely NO WAY all those people (first name only) were cured of illnesses by drinking one quart of green smoothies. Sorry... but NO WAY. Please, moles and warts just fell off.... That kind of claim is a total turn off. The recipes are plain old one cup of greens with fruit and ice. So basically eating one cup of spinach a day, ground up, will cure diabetes? Way over rated. I read it in one night and it is definitely not something I would want to keep as a reference for anything. Get it out of the library.",
"__label__2 It's the unthinkable!: The only reason that I am giving 4 stars is because the author did not list all the victims of Dr. SHipman's unsuspected reign of terror in Lancashire. In his long career, he probably killed at least 200 victims--men, women, children, for no apparent reason until he was stopped by the law. Sadly, I cannot stop thinking about all the victims who had dreams to see Israel, cruise, grow up, or old with their loved ones in Lancashire. Dr. Shipman was supposed to be respected and trusted with their lives; he killed his beloved patients without such motives at all. The book is an easy read unless you're trying to find out the victims and give them a proper memorial. This book is for those victims and their families! Maybe we can learn from what happened in Lancashire!",
"__label__1 Love him but this a terrible movie: The characters never really fully develop and, it's a dark miserable story with people running, crying, screaming, at times you need to stop and say to yourself what's going on. I felt nothing for him as a character neither did I feel anything for any of them, I wasn't socked I was bored.It's OK to watch on an airplane ride so you can fall asleep...from 1 to 10 I give a 5",
"__label__1 Great for baby bonding, bad for SIDS aspect.: I was very excited about this book, until my baby died of SIDS. I think it has some great info. on breastfeeding, etc., but the chapter on SIDS is simply incorrect.The author, like Dr. Sears, is a huge bed sharing advocate. The US Comsumer Product Safety Commission, just concluded a 8 year study that strongly advises against bed sharing to reduce SIDS. The American Academy of Pediactrics and US Public Health Svc. back up this study. Since our loss, it's important to me that the correct info. gets circulated. See the SIDS Alliance web page for more information about SIDS.",
"__label__2 Pedco Digital Ultrapod II: This is a really nice accessory for any photographer. It fully supports my ""tweener"" camera even while fully zoomed. It is extremely lightweight and durable. The strap is a great feature - I have strapped the tripod to railings, benches, tree branches, etc. It is easy to attach to my camera and has complete range of motion. I take it with me every time I grab my camera.",

"__label__2 Very helpful.: I ordered this to accompany the Pimsleur Language Russian program, as Pimsleur, although very powerful for learning to speak, has little more than a pamphlet to teach you to read. So, I picked this up, and it is very handy. It has made the process of learning to read fairly easay and enjoyable.I would have rated this a 3, however, because you lose a LOT of the meat of the book if you don't have the audio recordings, which aren't included in the book. At least, they weren't with mine. However, I poked around online and found that they're available for download off this website:http://mllc.utsa.edu/troika/student/mp3.htmI don't know how long that site will be up, but if you intend to use this book to teach yourself to read and speak, those MP3s will be invaluable.",
"__label__1 Not as it looks!: Heart pendant does not look as pretty as in the picture, there's this gold topaz covering on both sides that totally ruins the look of the normal Swarovski crystal, in other words, no colors shine at all.

"__label__2 I LIKE IT!!!: I love the compactness of this waterpik. I had the larger one and this one is far more convenient. You don't have to invert the reservoir and the power of the jet is actually stronger than the bigger model. Granted, the smaller amount of liquid in the reservoir was a little disappointing, but I just keep another cup ready to refill it while I am still using the pik. It is definitely easy to use and, of course, that means it will be used more often and the check ups at the dentist attest to the positive impact it has. I most often use a salt & warm water solution and it works great.",

Bad performances, coupled with awful direction and hackneyed, cliched writing puts this on my list of films to avoid. The film obviously tried to capitalize on Muniz's rising star power among youngsters and families, but offered little substance for this film to endure. There is never an indication at what makes this dog so special. And it' hard to believe that only two dogs were used for Skip; his appearance changes quite frequently throughout the film.If you want a recent ""uplifting"" family film, opt for ""The Sandlot.""",

As he begins by antagonizing others on ""Intro"" it continues over to ""Call My Name"" as he dares any competition to contest.

The highlight of this LP is ""What A Feelin'"" with its groovy, scale runs with the bass.

The only failure here is the ending which becomes a little too melodramatic and (I think) untrue to at least one of the characters.

It uses disposable dye cartidges that are threaded on both end with caps. When you are attaching the plunger and coupler hose, be aware that large end is sealed inside with the piston, but the small end will spill if it isn't held upright when you attach the coupler hose. I was very happy to see that the plunger assembly is entirely made of metal. It only has rubber covers on it.Not sure where it's made, there's no marking I can see. It's a well made injector, though.",

I can't believe that she has all of this in one book. Thank you, thank you, thank you! The patterns from ""Knitting on the Edge"" that I have used have all worked out. I have also easily been able to vary the patterns to work into the piece I was working on. She's made it very simple.

The only minor drawback is the lack of an externally visible fill level. The internal fill mark is just about impossible to see, so you really have to measure the water you put in. The automatic shut-off is a big plus. I previously had a similar Toastess model (Toastess TFC-326 Personal-Size 1-Cup Coffeemaker, Black) which was also a good coffeemaker. It had an external fill indicator, but it lacked the automatic shut-off. I kept forgetting to turn it off after making coffee, which probably contributed to its early demise.",

At the risk of sounding cliche', I must say this book tells a wonderful and inspiring story of love, personal growth, and following your dreams.

The detailing started to seem drawn out and it was difficult for me to finish. The build up to the conclusion was predictable ( in my opinion) which made it even more difficult to finish.

And those were based on brand new ideas ad licenses. Its not that the gameplay is bad. The multi-player is actually very well thought out.

The vocal melodies are Beatlesque in the best sense, made all the more impressive by Robin Zander's uncanny ability to sing like both Lennon and McCartney.

"__label__2 A highly detailed look at Honda Motorcycle history: Many books on motorcycles abound with glossy pictures but contain little facts. This slim volume by Roland Brown is quite the reverse. The majority of photos are original B&Ws, not staged fashion shots, and there is ample text. It is not a coffee table book, it is a real book! The history begins with Soichiro Honda's start after WWII and traces the company's progress to 1989. For the real motorcyclist there is plenty of technical detail which is used to show the evolution from one machine to the next, rather than being just tabulated facts. The story of the development of motorcycles, as we now know them, and the fascinating saga of a multinational company's growth, make excellent reading. My only complaint is that a book this slim (150 small pages), really doesn't warrant a price tag of $25. Never the less, I still bought it, and was glad I did.",

"__label__1 A Little Disappointed: I was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. Most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book. This was the first book on statistics and law that I bought and read, so I don't know how to compare it to others. But I will select and try another to see if what I am looking for is out there.",
"__label__1 Too expensive!: I would give this book 5 starts, becausae it is written by such a well-known and eminient Islamic scholar. However, the price is such a deterrant, no-one but financial institutions will read it. This is a complaint against many Islamic authors - they rip you off with the extortionate prices of their books. What happend to the Quranic injunction to spread knowledge??",
"__label__2 Few details on Con's and consistent warnings that you will be caught: I liked the book, although I was looking for a much more in depth treatment of the subject. The author consistently stresses that if you choose to be a con artist you will be caught and exhibits some frustration that con artists are not punished more severly than they are, since most con artist crimes are perceived as crimes the victims brought on themselves through their own greed and avarice.The title is somewhat misleading. Don't read this is you want to actually be a con artist as you won't learn too many tricks. There is a detailed explanation on how to short change someone, which I found interesting, but most other con artist tricks are given vague explanations.If you want to know about con artists read this as part of a more extensive study as it does not stand on its own as a resource.",

Best of all, neither dog's aggressive chewing appears to have made a dent in more than two weeks.Highly recommended. Great fetch item.",
__label__1 Are You People Kidding?: This is not a 5 star film. And I have to agree with Acute Observer in finding this not realistic or believable in many aspects. As flawed as our government is I highly doubt that the FBI would allow a club that hunts young black men to continue on while they look for more evidence. And I found it impossible to believe that Debra Winger's character could continue to love Berenger after discovering that he was a racist murderer. This film is a guilty pleasure- albeit a wierd one. It plays more like a tv movie than a brilliant feature film. It is extremely dated and is written for a junior high or high school level of intellect.,

"__label__1 Good Idea, Ineptly Done: I'd never read Sandra Brown, and, based on ""The Switch,"" won't look to read more.A potentially interesting plot was ruined by ludicrous dialogue, unbelievable characters, and extremely unlikely plot twists (even allowing for the initial premise). And anyone who was surprised by the ending ought to be ashamed.No, wait. That's not true. Readers who thought early on that they had spotted the ending were encouraged to think otherwise by the fact that in several places Brown refers specifically to Melina out of the context of a conversation. E.g. on page 344 a new chapter section begins: Melina repeated to Chief the half of the conversation that he hadn't overheard. Well, it wasn't Melina, we find at the end, so Brown effectively set up a climax, as it were, that made no sense.Too bad. Identical twins can make for interesting reading, but they don't make the grade here.",
"__label__1 Actually it should be no stars: I have only written reviews for books I have genuinely liked. This is the first time I have written a ""Don't buy this book"" warning.

"__label__1 Difficult to Read: A good way to describe this book might be to say that it is what /Reminiscence of a Stock Operator/ would have been like had Philip Roth written it.Many times while I was reading this, I had to look at the back cover and reread Ace Greenberg's quote: ""Buzzy Schwartz is a winner....All else is nonsense."" Because this book is so full of insipid nonsense, you might forget Schwartz is, in fact, a winner.I suggest checking it out at the library and reading only the last two chapters, which actually have something in them that could be called ""lessons"". (Please note the title of this book.) Forget the rest, it's nonsense. Like many other reviewers here have said, there is no system on a silver platter. Take what you can find and do your own research.Whatever you decide, realize that no great trader would ever ""need"" this book, certainly not for its ""psychological insights"".

"__label__2 A very good solo Raider entry: ""Death's Deal"" is a fine entry in the solo Raider Western novel series. This series of books focused on the character of Raider, working alone for the Pinkertons after Doc Weatherbee leaves the agency.Most of the plot is taken up with a grueling cattle drive, which brings out the courage and cowardice, good and evil of everybody involved. The major villain is more of a contemporary sociopath than the standard Western bad guy.The solo Raider books just don't have the quality of the earlier Hardin series, but this one is excellent.Highly recommended.",

After seeing it I wanted to open my skull and scoop out any memory of it. Do yourself a favor, if you are thinking about buying this mess please DON'T reproduce. The world has enough stupid people. And by the way Amazon, how about adding a negative stars option to the rating system. It felt dirty having to give this crap even one star.",

He smiled and said that would be going in the right direction but why not come all the way home. He gave me this book. Indeed I became a Roman Catholic.I count as kin and the best of friends and brothers in Christ many Orthodox. I am thankful and do believe that I understand them and their religion better than ever for reading this book. Though it condemns certain errors, Soloviev speaks with a true voice of love for the Orthodox.This personal note is all I can add to the excellent reviews that have gone before mine. I do recommend this book especially to Orthodox Christians who are so very important to the future of all Christendom.",
__label__1 How to waste (dollar amount): As an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell I think this book was garbage. What were you thinking?

I'm sorry I wasted my time and money.,

Boy was I wrong.What I don't understand is what possessed the author into thinking he had a novel in him? Someone deluded him horribly. The book is at times unreadable for any number of reasons. It is unbelievable nonsense, terribly written and edited, and historically inaccurate to the point of being laugh out loud stupid. Which is what I must have been for purchasing it without spotting that bulge of one star reviews.The book is very well reviewed by the authors friends and family and some people who owe him money and that is all.",
"__label__2 Great new band - Rossdale still has it!!!: I was a huge fan of Bush and now am a fan of Institute. It does sound similar to Bush, but probably because Gavin Rossdale writes all the lyrics and sings all the lead vocals.

"__label__2 An Underrated Guilty Pleasure: Although critically slashed upon its release it's actually a broad, very entertaining comedy with many funny sequences and performances. Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis are strangely miscast but are by no means bad. De Palma's direction is as stylish as ever and the cinematography is quite beautiful. Worth seeing for the eye-popping camerawork in opening five minutes alone. Had this been an original adaption the critical concensus would have been far better.The DVD offers a nice anamorphic widescreen transfer and no other extras but for the low price it's great.",
"__label__1 horrible: This is one of the worst surf movies ever! I mean all of the footage comes from other surf movies that are much much better, and it does not go into enough depth about the strapped crew. It says that laird hamilton and dave kalama are the onlt two apart of the crew, but there are about 10 more surfers in the actual crew. I have to say that also the guy who made this film did not do it very well. I mean you would expect Bruce Browns's son to make a better surf movie than this. (Bruce Brown made one of the best surf films of all time ""The Endless Summer"" series. Sorry but the person who made this film should know more about surfing before they make a film on it.",
"__label__2 Victorinox vs Leatherman: I have been a long time user of many tools from both companies and appreciate both of them equally. I mainly purchased this tool because I had not had a Leatherman in a long time.Another reason for going with this tool is I needed something I could carry in my pocket clipped. My Victorinox Swisstool Spirit doesn't have a clip on it and I'm not one to carry a pouch on my belt just to carry my tool. I have to dress professional at work and having a tool clipped inside my pocket is a little more subtle in my opinion.It has a different feel than my Swiss but I can already see how amazing it will be. The Swiss is beautiful, well layed out, smooth, and shiny where the Leatherman Charge TTi just looks mean. The blades on the Leatherman are wicked and the best they offer. Tools are a bit more out of the way but I love the one hand operation blades that I don't get on anything Victorinox that I have.",

"__label__2 Undiluted Truth, a Molotov Cocktail -: This book is like a Bible for dissidents. I've felt mentally and morally sick working in higher education for close to ten years now and just thought I was crazy. Gatto confirms that it is the system itself which is sick and that the people who run it and benefit are not honest and honorable people and one could fairly label them pathological, I'll even label them as pedophiles for raping the minds, spirits and souls of students. It's rare to see a man speak so truthfully and forcefully and passionately about what is missing today; honor, principle, character, creativity, imagination, independence, and dissent. I'm amazed this man hasn't been assassinated for exposing this dirty game. This book goes way beyond the narrow scope of education, he taps into a world view and value system which is heartening for me, he helps me understand why and how the world is so screwed up. This man should run for president in my opinion",

This epic is life, neatly set out in black type, and anyone with a life today will appriciate how similar it is to life 200 years ago.

The characters are shallow and the story is so predictable (if you have read the first two Sparks' novels). The lines are repeated time and time again to bring out the readers' emotions and none of the sentiments touched me deeply ... I'm sorry to say that the book was written to popularize tissue papers. Sparks tried to please the readers too much that he lost the charm that he had so deeply in ""The Notebook"". Please Nicholas, bring back your charm from ""The Notebook"" and stop trying to please the readers ... The Notebook is the best of his novels so far.",

I plodded through the last 100 or so pages hoping for an ending that would tie everything together or at least be a happy one for Trudi. Instead, the book just sort of petered out.

They are NOT durable...maybe they are more durable then the thinnest Crayola crayon but certainly not the jumbo crayons. The color is so light and barely there, it's not fun for young children. The crayons feel weird and are not at all like the color of the actual crayon when the color is on paper.

I thought I would be able to take from it what I could use, and discard everything else but the references were too frequent, and it put a really bad taste in my mouth, I felt I was being exposed to things that were very oddly relgious, (non-christian) and I am not interested in that. I purchased the book in hopes that I'd learn to eat a certain way for an overall healthy womb, but got a lot of other weird stuff, that made me uneasy, I couldn't finish the book.",

Whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. Keep in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for months. The panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. The primary colors of Blue Jean Teddy then become noticed. The green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. My baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. The only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. I would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as I and my baby wanted. But the reasonable price of this mobile AS WELL as the cute look of it made it a great buy. Educational baby products don't have to look weird!",

"__label__2 Spellbinding But Deceptive: Perhaps I have become desensitized, but I found the novel to be misleading; Cook spends a great deal of time foreshadowing a tragic, haunting event that ends up seeming anticlimactic; I expected something far more sinister.

Songs like ""Comet"" and ""Shiva"" are fun, frenetic numbers with a sardonic undertone. One of the best albums of all time? No, of course not.

Many examples use non-standard fonts that hard to find, making assignments unnecessarily difficult to complete, in some exercises after following all instructions the correct result would not match the examples given again creating difficulty not needed. This books suited for online classes because it often gives instructions which are completely irrelevant in such environment. The books gives a good amount of tips and tricks about MS Office, books needs revising and grouping of lessons.",

None of the characters in the film are sympathetic and Jar Jar is the worst creation in the history of film. Buying this movie is like telling George Lucas that it is okay to make a billion dollar movie with an awful script. The worst thing about this movie is that the computer special effects are the real star and there is no humanity or soul in the film. Star Wars was a great movie because it had characters people could relate to, but this movie has none. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS WORTHLESS MOVIE.",

I believe that the author relies too much on the economics of the region while avoiding telling us important events and information on the region.For example he never tells us why the islands were named with the names that they have today.Why Cuba? Where doest it come from? Why Antigua? Why Martinique? Sometimes this book reads like an economics report which makes it very dull and boring at times.I guess the author assumes you know most of the story.Again, very dull and dry history on a region that is full of history and action.",

It does NOT deserve to be one of those books students hate merely because it's required reading.The characters are as real as books get, the small town one that you might live in now, or your grandparents might have lived in decades ago. The issues - from racism, sibling relationships, and just plain growing up - touch your soul.

Sure, there might be a few plot holes, but they are not important.

He creates incredible lines without using any proper rhyme scheme; his formula is to be dead on with the beats, and at that he is incredible. While Sole's rapping skills cannot be argued with, I must say that the beats are the star of the album. Of all the hip-hop albums to emerge lately this one is 2nd only to El-P's 'Fantastic Damage'. Exceptional songs include 'Da Baddest Poet', 'Salt on Everything', and 'Plutonium'.",

There is no other similar product offered by the company for the NDS.

Patton did heroic things but there is no need to admire his flaws--and that includes his belief that crude and foul language somehow made him a better man and general, and that he thought he knew more about mental damage than doctors.

In addition, they just weren't very comfortable at all. It felt like I had a bunch of hard rubber nipples pressed against my foot (and that's pretty much what it was). I guess if you want shoes that you can spray off with the garden hose, then these will work for you. But, if you want something more comfy, try Teva, or Keen.",

While I agree that I would like Emily to be a little more ""forceful"" in the book, I believe it truly depicts some of the struggles a young, Christian woman would have in NYC. I found it funny and inspiring. I would recommend it as a gift for any young, Christian woman who is going off to college or life after college. Asks some good questions, that are not always easy to answer!",
"__label__1 Recycled and shallow... is this really Marquez ?: The protagonist of this book mentions a Latin quote: ""No old man forgets where he has hidden his treasure"" Well....in this case it seems that Marquez has forgotten exactly that: the place where he has hidden his superb skills as a narrator of fascinating, magic realistic stories.The novel is a shallow, disappointing story about a 90 years old bachelor and his love for a teenage virgin he likes to watch while she sleeps. The magic atmosphere of the small South American city which is Marquez forte in other novels feels like a strained recycled background to an unsatisfying story.Is it possible that like Salvador Dali at old age allowing young painters to imitate his style, this book was written by a ghost writer while the old master nods his head slowly in the heat of an afternoon siesta in Macombo ?",

"__label__2 A Barbarian's Love Story: Irony, agony, and love are the major elements in Peter Hargitai's novel, Atilla: A Barbarian's Love Story. Atilla's struggle to free himself from the shackles of the past customs is an emotional rollercoaster.His post-modern fiction would be appreciated by generations who find themselves agonized by people's rejections of the joining of multicultural societies. Some may criticize the novel for the ordinary love story, however, it's what makes it worthy to read. Peter Hargitai was anything but close-minded about the current ""melting pot"" in America, and this is what the world needs. Even if the beginning may not be in sync with the rest of the book, it's a nice sense of Hungarian history. Despite some technical errors, the overall jist of the novel is enjoyable.",

"__label__2 Nice but a bit ""watered down"": ""Rain"" is a classic pre-censorship movie of the 30's. As usual with this type of film, one must do a fair amount of reading between the lines to get the full story. Joan Crawford gives a strong performance as Sadie Thompson, a trollop on the run from the law. Walter Huston as Alfred Davidson, a bible thumping, over the top preacher, is sufficiently scary. The rest of the cast puts in fine performances. The cinematography is also exceptionally elegant.The story is a bit watered down from it's Somerset Maugham original, and some extreme leaps of believability are needed on the part of the audience to accept the denouement. But the story is strong and powerful and surprisingly up-to-date considering it is almost 70 years old. It would seem the religious right has been throwing its muscle around longer than we think.I highly recommend ""Rain"", if for no other reason than to see Joan Crawford in the type of role that made her famous.",
"__label__2 Simply superb dance music !: Superb! That's the only word I find to qualify this excellent compilation. Once you buy it, stop listening to it becomes impossible. The day it arrived I listened to it three times in a row. I've known only ""I like Chopin"" from the 80's, I think no other music from Gazebo has been played on radio in Brazil during all these years. I simply got astonished because all the other musics from this cd are quite so good as ""I like Chopin"". And I finally could get a original version of this classic song, both single edit and the LP version. I only had the remix version from the 90's. I really loved ""Wrap the rock"", ""Gimmick"", ""For Anita"" and ""Telephone Mama"". Although the price of 29 dollars plus shipping and the 60% tax I paid to my country's customs it was completely worthy awhile. Thanks for Amazon and Gazebo for this really enjoyable cd !",

The only complaint is the quality of the DVD Menus and such. The graphics just have a cheap feel and the selection 'bug' disapears into the background from time to time. Not a fatal flaw, but glaring compared to the quality of the shows.The missing espisodes explain alot too - why Irna was leaving at the begining of 'Objects in Space' (my fav) and more of Mal and Zoe's history.

And yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. Events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. Instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in Houdini's life. Relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. Also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. I would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.The book is enjoyable only insomuch as Houdini's life was fascinating. Too bad the complete effects of this interesting life are lost within the puzzle of pages.",

The main reason is that the characters in Swan Song did not have enough depth. They were either ""good"" or ""bad."" I would have liked to see some of Swan's bad traits and some of Alvin's good traits, for example. Very few people, if any, are either purely good or purely evil in real life, and I felt that this is where Swan Song lacked credibility. Sometimes I actually felt like cheering for the bad guys because Swan was just too sugary sweet. Other than that, it was a decent book, worth reading.",

It is a trip to hell.One of the main strengths of the novel is its author's voice, who brings something of a modern sensibility to material that could otherwise be dated.

This is the story of Paul, the son of a Roman legionnaire in Britain, who sets out on a journey to Rome, avoiding gangsters along the way, to take a message to the Emperor, and try to save an innocent man's life. It has everything: adventure, humor, and a lover's description of Rome. This book should not be out of print!",

The only minus we have is that the inside is stained--but that's from the cochinita pibil, which braises in a red achiote sauce.

She was sent off to a forced labor camp where she suffered horribly under Hitler's vicious rule. She experienced things that are just mind boggling. Starvation, illness, and so much more.

My wife and I love seeing Indian movies about the conflicts between traditional Indian society and modernity. In these movies, the family is both part of the plot and oftentimes comic relief. However, I didn't laugh once during this film. It's a serious love story, but mixed with the dancing and fairy tale setting, it's hard to take seriously.A related problem is that this movie simply had too much singing and dancing.

"__label__2 Good Singin' Good Playin"": The Amazing Rhythm Aces third and fourth albums - compiled on this disc - are not the revelations that the first two albums were. That said, the music on this disc is better than 95% of what you will find in ANY music store - online or otherwise - anywhere in the world.Music fans have been waiting for this music for many years. Either one of these discs would be worth the price of a CD. To get them on the same disc is hitting the jackpot.The Aces blend country, R&B, and soul into a brew so potent that you'll surely find yourself addicted after just a listen or two.This disc is a MUST BUY!",
__label__2 Excellent Basic Training Book: Telling Ain't Training is a well written book that covers the basics of designing and delivering training. I would recommend it to anyone who is becoming part of a training organization.,
"__label__1 Good movie for taking a nap: Saying that this movie is slow would be an understatement. Molasses moves faster. I'm usually a bit leary of films written and directed by the same person and in this case I was right to be. Somehow I managed to watch the first 40 minutes without completely falling asleep. After that I started fast forwarding. As one reviewer said, it's an interesting concept done with very poor execution.",
"__label__2 physic sience: I have had , and read this book before, Loaned it out, and it never got returned. This is an awesome book",
"__label__2 Clint Eastwood Western Icon Collection: This is a great collection of a few Clint Eastwood westerns through Universal. There are two disks with Two Mules for Sister Sara on it's on disk, with no double sided disks. All movies are in color and in Widescreen format and there isn't any linear notes or booklet with the DVD. These movies also star; Shirley MacLaine, Robert Duvall, John Saxon, Dick Van Patten, Mitch Ryan, Marianna Hill, Verna Bloom, Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez, plus others! Overall this is a great set of movies and if you don't have any of these films I would recommend getting this.",
"__label__1 Dreadful: I am a fan of dba & 65dba, in their incarnations AFTER this album. This album has nothing to do with their later electronic dance pop sounds. The only song on this album that resembles that sound is track #2, ""We Must Go."" This album is blatantly evangelistic in lyrics, and the music is very churchy ensemble music -- even in the realm of CCM, this is bad. Avoid this album. If you're looking for dba's electronic dance pop sounds, the 1996 album ""Bubble"" is a good choice, and is an album I still enjoy listening to. Much later I bought 1994's ""Shout"" -- not as good as ""Bubble"" but good enough for me as a dba fan.",

"__label__1 Don't bother!!!!: First let me say I know this album well, and it is essential for any fan of Ron Dante, or the Archies. The problem here is that the mastering is so godawful poor! It seems to be mastered from a record-and judging from the nauseating sound of all the side two tracks (6-10), the record used was pressed off-center!!! Artwork bears no resemblance to original, and mine came with a booklet but no tray card! Add to that the fact that 2 tracks are missing from the original release, and this makes the disc useless. Most Dante fans already have a copy of the vinyl, and that is a superior copy to own at this point. Wait for Ron to reissue this himself-he'll do better...",

"__label__2 Excellent game.: Madden 2004 is a great game for the average EA Sports fan. There aren't many flaws and Madden is great with his commentary. The stadiums are of high detail. The gameplay is great. Sometimes it won't load. If you have run a different program before you play it, odds are it won't load either at the beginning or the end. I like the trophy presentation at the end of a victory in the Championship game or the Super Bowl. It's a great game with excellent commentary from Madden and Al Michaels.",
"__label__1 Trash.: If you want a USB notebook cooler that's going to last a few weeks with minimal use, go right ahead. The plastic feet came off, the power light is a blue/purple strobe that could compete with local law enforcement, and the dual cords (power/USB) is cumbersome.",

__label__1 directors cut horrible: I have always been a major fan of this movie. I got the first DVD a couple of years ago but it was a bit of a hassle to get up in the middle and turn it over. I was excited by the new two disc version in which the entire movie was now on one side. GREAT I thought. Then the extra scenes popped in which totally were unnecessary and detracting from the plot. Gratuitous nudity and thin scenes that should have been left on the film edit floor. I cant understand what they substatially did for this great movie other than significantly dilute it. I guess I'll go back to my first DVD and just take a popcorn break when I have to get up and chnage sides,
"__label__1 What is this?: What has Rush turned themselves to? This is a horrible CD, only that. There's no point in trying to justify these plastic, incoherent and comercial songs saying ""we're trying new ways"", ""this is our best album so far"", ""we do what gives us pleasure"". One only needs to compare it with ""Moving Picture"", ""Permanent Waves"" and a handful of others Rush recordings!!",
"__label__1 Christie is a shallow narcissist: After viewing this video, it seems clear that Christie Brinkley is a self-centerd, shallow, narcissist. No wonder she burned through four poor husbands.",

"__label__2 Simply outstanding: Everything in this DVD is wonderful--Helen Liang's technique is simply top-notch. My only critique is that for those unfamiliar with the snake style, the DVD lacks a step-by-step breakdown of how to execute each phase of the form. Some of the techniques and postures are rather complicated, and may require extra time and patience in order to be successfully digested. Don't let that be a put-off for getting this video, however; this program is really a delight once you have put in the time and figured out how to dance the dance.",
"__label__2 Finally, the complete set!: The thin cases are a welcome addition when you buy this ""upgrade"" edition. The picture quality of the DVDs is top notch. An outstanding collection.",
"__label__1 The book tries to be too difinitive.: The book is a broad and detailed manual covering the entire list of restoration steps and processes, but what the book fails to account for are manufacturing differences created by the various GM assembly plants. An example is that a 65 Chevelle model from the Kansas City plant will have more undercarriage parts painted than the car assembled at the Fremont, California plant. The book tends to state ""the part appears this way and this way only"" on a properly restored car and makes no accounting of mid-year changes or manufacturing location difference. I certainly hope this book is never used to judge concours Chevelle restorations.For the restorer wishing to learn great deals of general information about restoring a Chevelle, this can be a good reference tool, it just needs to be taken with a grain of salt not not used as the sole source of restoration information.",

I purchased the valeo neoprene waist belt instead for the same price and its lasted me 3 weeks, makes me sweat even more and hasn't worn yet.",

Bought this thinking I would step it up a notch but, the cueing is so bad you end up stopping to say WHAT!! The most disconcerting thing is that the steps are off the beat of the music and that drove me crazy. It's a tough workout if you can get in your own groove but I find myself using this the least of all the Firms workouts.",
"__label__1 Good God, this SUCKED.: Scott, keep WALKING, as FAR away as you can get from ever writing another book. You can't recap, your rants suck, and you get all pissy and whiny whenever anyone has a problem with anything you say or do. This is the worst book I have ever read, in any genre, including Chyna's book. Rantsylvania - We Really Do Suck.",
__label__1 The Wachowski Brothers really drop the ball with this one.: We waited this long for this? A movie that not only does not make a heap of sense but is a major let down in the most profound sense of the word. Its seems to me that the Wachowski Brothers only concentrated on the special effects but forgot about writing a compelling plot to go with it. The mythology that made the first Matrix such a classic is thrown out for an incoherent cyber juke of a story that not only insults the legion of fans but makes them look stupid for waiting around for theses sequels.The Wachowski Brothers should be a shame of themselves for ripping off the fans of the first movie.,
"__label__2 It Holds Yer Coffee!: Yes, this carafe holds coffee, and does a superb job. But it can also store tea, hot water, soup, hot chocolate, marbles, you name it!I've purchased two of these now. My first one broke (it stopped keeping coffee hot), and the second one is for my wife. She likes to drink that crappy flavored coffee, and I don't want it tainting my Italian roast Colombian experience.",

He loves making me a cup of coffee or grilling a burger for dad.My husband and I put this toy together in about 30-45 minutes. I'm sure it would have been harder with only one person. The instructions say not to use a drill, but we did and it was no problem -- much easier/faster!All of our doors fit fine, maybe we just got lucky? I agree more noises would have been nice, but that's what there imagination is for, right?!I definitely recommend this toy!",

"__label__1 AGES OLD and nothing else--NOT the BBC documentary: I was sorely disappointed upon receiving this product,as i was expecting the 1988 BBC documentary called ROCK OF AGES that you can find on youtube......The front cover looked from that era and being reasonably inexpensive,i just assumed that it must be one in the same.ALL this dvd is,is a collection of videos ANY def leppard fan has seen a jillion times.BUMMER",
"__label__1 Total rip off!!!!: I bought the 40 ounce version on Ebay with free shipping for $28.00. I was expecting MUCH more for the high price. The Kleen kanteen is NOT insulated at all. If you put something cold in it, expect it to get warm really fast. If you put hot stuff in it (like me), expect it to get cold fast. Expect to burn your fingers every time you pick it up. Expect to burn your inner lip on hot metal ever time you take a sip. The steel is VERY thin. I expect that if i dropped it, it would certainly dent.This product is honestly worth about 6-8 dollars. If I bought it from their website for $28 AND paid the high shipping cost, I'd be enraged when the product arrived. It's simply way too expensive.",
"__label__2 Remover tool works great!: Ordered this to help get contacts OUT of my eyes. I don't have trouble getting them in, so I haven't used the insertion tool.

The vinyl is extremely thin and actually tore as I was putting it on. The vinyl is very cheap and you can practically see right through it. I previously had a similar cover and it was thick, lined, padded, etc. This is a single thin sheet of vinyl like a cheap outdoor tablecloth.",
"__label__1 2nd Ed Forgotten Realms Boxed Set-Better left in the Box: Just FYI: This review is for the 2nd Edition boxed set, not the D&D3; hardcover.There is much to the old axiom of 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it', and as cliche as it might be, it holds very true to the 2nd Edition Forgotten Realms boxed set. Oversized text and space wasting boarder art notwithstanding, the 2nd Ed boxed set incorporates all of the nonsense of the 'Time of Troubles' trilogy of novels. It also adjusts the Dale Reckoning time line by almost a hundred years for no reason. It gives scant overviews of too large of an area, and almost nothing on the things that really matter, like characters, noble houses, and rivalries between states. It also brings out the worst of the Realms, like munchkin characters such as Drizzt Du'Urden and Elminster. Stick with the grey 1st Edition Boxed Set, it's a much superior version.",
"__label__1 Have not read the book: I will admit upfront that I have not read nor will I read this book. But let me say this about R.C. Sproul.He's a smart man with a good deal of natural intelligence but in many ways he has wasted his life by supporting a dying cause - Calvinism.The Reformed and Presbyterian denominations in the U.S. are dying, and indeed are on their deathbed, and all of Sproul's intelligence cannot nor will it change the reality of this dying heresy.Calvin was wrong from the beginning and Sproul was wrong to take his God-given mind and use it to try to prop up Calvinism.I will say again, Calvin was wrong from the start. The Holy Spirit is nowhere present in the writings of Calvin anymore than He is present in the writings of Sproul because the Holy Spirit is not the Spirit of division and untruth.What a terrible waste, but this is what happens when your father in the faith is not Jesus Christ but John Calvin.",
"__label__1 You'll be sorrrrry!: This thing, as a polite term, is cheap and poorly made. If you do not intend to sit in it but rather, use it as a visual piece for selling a house, this may be for you. Otherwise, save your hard earned money! Shortly after using it a weld cracked. I am not huge or hold elephants in my lap. This left the chair unstable and made impossible to drink coffee while seated.Regarding the weld failure, I understand that stuff from china needs help. I paid to have that repaired at a machine shop. The welder said it was just soft steel. In my opinion, this is a short term product and is produced to be sold. Repeat customers? That's a laugh. Without reservation I can say that I wouldn't buy another mac product; ever. Almost omitted this....whatever cushioning the seat provided when new soon evaporated. No kidding, it's a joke (on consumers)!",

"__label__1 Nothing New: There is nothing new in this book. It was written to ""preach to the choir"", to cement pre-existing opinion rather than to present evidence and change minds. Researched with a ""have a theory, we'll find facts to support this theory"" rather then any real scientific method. Claims that God's marriage plan of one man, one woman was set in stone from the beginning of time, yet ignores that polygamy and use of concubines was God's rule of the day in the Old Testament. Even if it were not poorly written, the thought process investing in this book is lacking.",

"__label__1 The Charm Escapes Me Completely!: I couldn't even get through half of this poorly-written book. It was as though the authors were trying way too hard to think of catchy descriptive words to fit in ad nauseum. I thought it would be ""hilarious"", but I didn't find it funny in the slightest, in fact it was very boring and empty. It didn't hold my attention, the characters were one dimensional and the writing was oh, so completely bad!I found myself thinking after turning virtually every page, ""what a waste of time this is"". I finally tossed it into my garage sale box after forcing myself to read almost 1/2 of the book. The popularity of this mindless piece (rather than the subject) makes me worry about the state of society!",
"__label__2 Not used to The Used: I thought this CD needed a review from someone who had never heard The Used before and wasn't comparing it to their previous albums. That would be me.The weak tracks on this album are the slower ones, ""Find a Way"" and ""Smother Me."" A few of the other tracks may be a bit poppy for some tastes (""With Me Tonight"" springs to mind), but they're musically solid.I have to agree it sounds a little overproduced, but I still enjoy it immensely and listen to it nearly every day. ""Pretty Handsome Awkward"" is particularly good when you're stuck in traffic!",

This book did a better job of describing all the types of adoption and more than a dozen subtypes. I thought the strategies in the book to adopt quickly and beat the odds were really clever. I liked the casual and easy manner the author explains the information. The author sounded very caring and ethical. I felt like he was just talking to me and explaining everything in a way that made complete sense to me. I found the summary of each state's laws in the back of the book and the biographies of adoption attorneys in each state really interesting and helpful.",

The book will interest political scientists as much as historians or just simple readers ( as myself) because of its explicit orientation to "" International history"" .

If price is an issue, RAISE IT! I for one would be glad to pay up to $45 a season if I could get it all and I'm sure I'm not alone. For now I'll keep watching my bootlegged DVD's that I paid $150 for all the seasons with all the memories. But it sure would be nice to have a nice, pretty, clean studio release to enjoy.

"__label__2 Metheny is our Mozart: While not my favorite Pat Metheny selections, certainly this vid will be much appreciated by Metheny afficianados. watching how he makes his music is revealing, to see the facial expressions as his fingers work their magic, especially how his mouth moves - as if the sounds coming from his instrument were in reality coming from his very soul - grin - which of course, they are. A culmination of much of the life long theme that characterizes his work, which any Pat Metheny fan will instantly recognize, this piece is the pure essence of the Man who is surely the Mozart of our age.Jonathan R.

"__label__2 Working great so far: This type of humidifier works ultrasonically, which is very quiet and puts out a lot of moisture. The vibrating membrane that creates the mist does get clogged over time with minerals if you have hard water. It can be cleaned to a point, but eventually it might stop misting. You will find a fine layer of sticky mineral gunk all over the room (on any exposed surface), unless you have soft water. There are additives you can put in the water to minimize this. Small rooms may get too humid unless it's on the lowest setting. We have been pleased with this one so far.",
__label__2 HISTORICAL DRAMA: .....If you don't mind literary licence this is a pretty good story of the Abolitionists and the pro-slavery forces that led to the Civil War. Raymond Masey gives a dynamic performance as the fanatical John Brown who wanted to free the slaves by inciting them to revolt......The movie also pairs Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland for one of their many appearance together with the lovely miss DeHavilland as the love interest of both Flynn and Ronald Reagan with Flynn emerging victorious......Altogether it is an enjoyable film that combines history with fiction and a love story thrown in for good measure.,

"__label__1 Nice idea, but DOESN'T WORK: I agree with the person who tried this diet for 7 weeks, lost 5 lbs. the first week, then nothing else happened. That's exactly what happened to me! I started on January 18th (nine weeks ago) and I finally quit in disgust a few days ago. What WAS true is that you lose your food cravings during the day (I stuck to protein and vegetables/salad during breakfast and lunch.) What is NOT TRUE is that your daily reward meal (usually at dinner) will enable you to lose weight. In other words, my food craving stopped, but I didn't lose weight! As a matter of fact, I started gaining weight in weeks two, three and four before again reversing. I agree in principle with everything said in this book (including the need to regulate insulin/blood sugar.)

"__label__1 Don't waste your money on this one.: I don't like this book for following reasons:- The source code can't be used on a project due to bugs and poor quality.- The author does not know what Java Beans are but goes on to provide a buggy utility class.- About 30% of the book is dedicated to non XML related concepts such as EJBs and Servelts etc.,- Does not explain the concepts of DOM L1/L2 in detail.- Does not describe JAXP in sufficient detail.There are few more reasons, but I will stop here due to lack of time...The landscape of Java & XML is very dynamic. There are lots of good books on XML but there are no good ones that provide good conent in the context of Java and JAXP. There is no point in buying this book unless company is paying for it.",

There's more towns dead than alive out there! Modern cities and highways are shownin black ink, and the ghost towns and historic places in red, complete with anecdotesdocumenting their significance and the years they existed. Useful in combination with Delorme'sNevada and California atlases (which you might need to actually find these towns, given the small scale of the ghost town maps).",

A slow plot would be OK, if the characters were capable of some Joycean epiphany, but epiphany is made impossible by the philosophy",
"__label__2 One of the all-time great Westerns: ""Shane"" is deservedly known as one of the great Westerns.""Shane"" is the story of a gunfighter who comes to the aid of a family of settlers who are being persecuted by free-rangers. There a many allusions to Christ in the character of Shane - his sensitivity, his serenity, his humbleness, his restraint, his self-sacrifice, even the fact he is only ever referred to by one name.Shane is perfectly played by Alan Ladd matched by Brandon de Wilde as the young boy Joey who idolizes Shane, and Jack Palance is appropriately sinister as the ""bad guy"".""Shane"" is superbly staged and shot with great use of foreground and background shot compositions particularly in the bar-room sequences - and who can forget the final sequence. This film more that any other mythologizes the Western. A stunning achievement by director George Stevens.",

Kirtland refers to Masaaki Hatsumi, Stephen K. Hayes, Jack E. Hoban, Bud Malmstrom, Glenn J. Morris, and Christopher Hunter/Ashida Kim. Stephen Hayes does a excellent foreword in this book.

"__label__2 Music: OK I understand everyone's point of view in thier comparisons between the stage production and the movie. I've heard both soundtracks. Personally I prefer the newer one because I can relate to it. Music was never about what notes a person can hit or how well trained they are. It is about the emotion it inspires. I don't feel as much in the original cast production. It just seems more realistic that the Phantom should sound more seductive to express why Christine would be torn between him and pretty boy. I really enjoyed Gerry's singng because when he sang I knew how he felt. That's the point isn't it?I prefered Emmy as well. Sarah had a tendency to make the words less understandable in order to make her training more evident.I went and saw the movie almost a week ago and still have the music there, inside my mind.I definitly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the story and thinks the Phantom should be dark and more mysterious than he was portrayed prevoiusly.",

I love the pockets, as they catch a lot of the mess & end up protecting little laps as well(& my kids have learned to eat ""seconds"" out of the pocket). They are so easy wash or rinse & they dry very quickly. I usually use one bib per day-rinse between meals/snacks & hang dry-then the bib is dry & ready for the next meal or snack.

"__label__2 One of the best cognitive books I've ever read: A must for those who are familiar with Luria's works, Assessment of Cognitive Processes is a wonderful book, explaining the best intelligence theory to date: the PASS theory of intelligence. Focusing more on abilities and not in capacities or mere base of knowledge, the PASS stands for Planning, Attention, Simultaneous and Successive processes. I use a lot this theory in conceptualizing my cognitive and neurocognitive cases. The PASS Remedial Pogram (PREP) who stand for PASS Reading Enhancement Program is very useful for children with reading disorders, training them to develop Succesive and Simultaneous strategies. A wonderful addition to the field. If you are a cognitive psychologist or a school psychologist and do a lot of work with children this is the right book for and introduction to remedial instruction",

"__label__2 A cohesive electronic statement: This album is a huge departure from The Sea and Cake's previous album, Oui. On Oui, the songs were very warm, the synthesizers were used to support the traditional rock instruments. On One Bedroom, the songs, while still engaging, are more electronic and alien. The guitar steps aside for the synthesizer, and the drum machines seem to appear more than the drum set. The division between songs that center on more traditional rock arrangements and more electronic compositions is actually pretty equal. What's amazing is that the album is cohesive enough to make the instrumental songs flow seamlessly with the heavily electronic songs. Not only do the songs flow well on this album, the cover of David Bowie's ""Sound + Vision"" makes sense next to the original compositions. So, if you're interested in the Chicago music scene, if you like electronic music, or if you're a fan of tasteful light rock, go listen to this album now.",

The singing is all in Spainish, which i only know a little, but it doesnt take away from the music. Its almost poppy at times..but the guitar work and sound is awesome Iommi-like. Only 8 songs clocking in at just over 30 minutes..its too bad they never had anything after this..i would have loved to seen where they would have taken it. Apparently there is still a version of this band sans the singer(who is in some religious cult) is still playing in South America..someone should record them too.",

I am still a huge fan of songs he did with the Doobies (i.e. Nothing But a Heartache, Dedicate this Heart, Your Made that Way, Losin End, etc.) and I liked If That's What it Takes, but most songs on Blue Obssession are nothing more than Easy Listening music that's not so easy to listen to.

"__label__1 Well-acted but hard to understand: This movie has beautiful acting and cinematography but it is difficult to pick up the various threads and make sense of them, particularly if you are unfamiliar with the Virginia Wolfe novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway"". The movie centers around three women, Virginia Wolfe, played by a hard-to-recognize Nicole Kidman; an unhappy young housewife from the 50's, played by Julianne Moore; and a modern-day woman played by Meryl Streep. Their stories interweave with one another and there are common themes of mental illness, lesbianism and unhappy women with death wishes. Not exactly light entertainment! There were times when I wanted to tell the main characters to snap out of it and get on with life rather than wallow in the melancholy and self-pity which they display. This is a movie designed more for art than for entertainment, so be forewarned.",

It would turn off by itself and wouldn't turn back on until you unplugged it and then hit the sleep button (pushing the ""on"" button had no effect). It was also EXTREMELY noisy even in ""low"" mode. I kept it in the very lowest setting as a result which meant it ceirculated very little air and was more or less useless.I lived with it for a few months. Now the timer on the screen indicates the filter needs to be cleaned. After I cleaned the filter, I followed the directions to reset the counter, but pushing the ""reset"" button doesn't return the screen to show 100% clean filter.

"__label__1 This so-called children's book is not really for children: I found this book rather sentimental and unsubtle, at least too much so for my taste. More importantly, I don't think this book is really for children. I don't think kids will relate to the father's emotion about his daughter, or simply may not perceive it: 'And he was smiling' may not be enough for kids. It doesn't help that the father is never depicted -- makes it harder still to identify with or understand this important character. And once the girl becomes a woman, I'm afraid that kids will feel very separate from her and so again not feel the deep emotion that many adults feel. This author has lots of fans, and many will enjoy the book no matter what, but in my opinion, as a children's book, it's flawed.",

I have trimmed out houses, cabinets, and various small projects with no problems at all. The quick release jamming mechanism is a great idea, but I've only had to use it once since I've had the nailer(this thing just won't jam up). It has good power but won't send the nail spiraling through the wood. Of course the swivel exhaust port comes in handy just remember to use it. The imprint the nailer leaves on the wood is virtually none except for the nail entry hole, much better than other finish nailers that I've seen.

While the extra dolls were exactly what I was looking for, the rest of the set was a complete disappointment.

I've tried the other ""Dry Hair"" products and the Island Naturals and White Camellia left my hair too soft or oily and I didn't like the smell of the Desert Herb as much as I like the Honeysuckle Rose. I use the GPB conditioner at home because I have soft water there and the Honeysuckle Rose can make my hair too soft.

I am at my wits end with this thing and I've experimented endlessly with this polarizer and can't for the life of me get a decent, clear shot. This shouldn't be called a polarizer it should be called a bluririzer. I guess it's true you get what you pay for, but keep the money you'd spend on this clunker an apply it to a better filter.",
"__label__2 Should be the first of a new series!: I was surprised that this mystery-thriller was so well written. Nikki Hill has great promise as a continuing character, as do several others in the story. Interesting plot and the DA office setting could even be expanded.I'd like to know how much was written by Darden & how much by Lochte.",
"__label__2 Pleasant and recommended reading (but plot could be better): The elegant writing and the well-paced daily life of the main character in this book make for a pleasant, rewarding reading. The descriptions of places and people are very nice.It's good to learn that Ron Ely, after gracing our TVs in Tarzan stories, produced a nice written work like this.I found the plot a bit weak, and it shows especially at the end. I would have given the book 3 and a half stars, if that was possible.",
"__label__2 Fantastic: I have followed Collegium for a while and was a little daunted with their recent trend for bringing out 'contemporary' composers. I now believe this to be a fantastic idea, having listened to this disc - what a DISCOVERY O'Regan is!Well done Collegium - I want to hear more!",

Poe's sound is differenent from Pj harevey, tori amos, and Fiona Apples, as they have been compared (i don't know why?). Poe as a really pretty voice, and plays piano very well. This is a very good album, everyone should own it. If only she could get more radio play....",
__label__1 Don't waste your time!: I don't know what the point of this book was. It took 102 pages to develop the so called 'mystery.' I knew I should have stopped reading but all the reviews had said what a good writer this author was. I stuck with it and now regret doing so. This is a very simple book with a lot of things that need to happen in a cetain way and of course they do. The characters seem to be living in the 1930's even though this takes place in current time. They all are naive people. This is my second book by this author and I will not make the mistake of reading a third book! You shouldn't either.,

"__label__2 Great camera!: I've had an Olympus camera (1.3 MP, those were good ol' times), a Sony Cybershot (4.1 MP) and a Canon Powershot A520, but this one beats all of them and more.The screen is great, it takes great photos and the autofocus comes very handy (especially for us lazy guys who do not want to take manual pics).The only drawback this camera has, and this is a negative feature for all Canon cameras (Canon, can you hear me?), is that it doesn't show battery status but only when it is almost done with batteries. I guess you can live with that (I've had), but it would be nice to have a battery meter so I know what to expect.",
"__label__2 All lids should be like this: It looks a little like a medieval torture device, but the little cones on the underside of the lid allow moisture to drop back into the pan. Why doesn't everyone do this? Plus the lids has two little tabs that fit over the pour spouts of the pan - perfect! Nice tight fit. Great for anything that needs to stew for awhile.",
"__label__1 I would give it no stars, if that was an option: I am a lay person who reads a great deal of books about time and general/special relativity. Unfortunately, I was duped into buying this book by the reviews on the back of the book and the snazzy cover.However, the author simply rambles on and on and on, and never presents any scientific or mathematical proof that his theory is correct. This is quite simply the worst book on this subject that I have ever read. The ""End of Time"" has reinforced my position that I will never again buy another book in a bookstore without first having read the reviews on Amazon.com",

"__label__1 Feminist propaganda that goes nowhere: Once again, too bad zero ratings aren't allowed.This movie is just another piece of feminist propaganda from the late 1970s that regurgitates the usual anti-male spiel and has nothing of any substance to offer. The fact that the ""heroine"" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. She has her ""individuality"" and that's about it. George Harrison's song ""I Me Mine"" should have been playing in the background at that point.Blecch.",
"__label__1 hidden envy fuels the pen: Christopher Byron is a barely-contained little nut of rage whose transparent drive to make fun of or denigrate the powerful, seems his way of touching the hem of powerful, successful people. He appears to be in great need to vent his envy and impotence. Worthless read.",
"__label__1 Terrible Colorization: This version of the movie on VHS is not recommended for collectors. The movie is colorized, apparently by a kindergartener with crayons. Blotches of pink and orange for faces and a torch which burns with green, orange, and yellow flames are evidence that the colorizing process was done in a haphazard manner with no concern for the quality of the job. The movie itself is quite good although I personnaly prefer the Richard Chamberlain version. 2 stars for a really bad print of a good movie.",
"__label__2 Altogether a great CD: While I think it's fair to say that Orbital rarely disappoints, I find their latest effort excellent. Within minutes oflistening to the the first few tracks I was hooked. The Altogether will definitely be in my CD rotation for a while.From the perspective of Orbital's past works, I find this CD better than Middle of Knowhere and nearly on par (andsoon to supersede?) In Sides. If you've enjoyed Orbital's past work, then you should enjoy this CD. For those ofyou who don't like Orbital (which I believe is an acquired taste), you may begin to change your mind after hearingwhat they've done on The Altogether.",
__label__2 Good...: This purchase I made for my daughter as caillou is her favorite character and she like this very much. Worth buying...I recommend...,
__label__2 Nice earrings from Amazon: I bought the earrings for my daughter who adored them. They were small but bright and looked great. We went to view the floats the night before the Rose Parade and a couple of her friends commented on them. She loves them.,
__label__2 Better than a diaper bag: I use this instead of a diaperbag. It holds more and I can organize things better so I don't have to dig around for what I need. The only complaint is that it seems like the fabric JanSport uses doesn't seem as sturdy and thick as it used to be. We'll see how it holds up.,
__label__2 Nice gadget: Overall I like this headphone and it serves it's purpose. The radio is pretty clear and the remote control is a neat feature. One bad thing is the cord from the the adapter to the remote control is too long. It is very hard to manage and gets tangle very easily.,

__label__2 The perfectly named film: This film is so much fun I didnt want it to end. Amy Adams is transcendent in her role as the Princess to be Giselle. She shouldve gotten an Oscar for this performance. For me it is one of the most enjoyable and delightful performances Ive seen in a long time.I had to practically be forced to watch this film since it seemed on the surface like a kids film I didnt want to see. I was wrong. It is a film for everyone. It is funny and touching and has scary moments and great singing and dancing and its a beautiful film to behold in every way.I loved this film.,

Featuring almost the entirety of Rucker's professional short-story output, ""Gnarl!"" includes hysterical and visionary pieces reminiscent of authors ranging from Kurt Vonnegut to Bruce Sterling (whose collaborative effort ""Big Jelly"" is featured here alongside gems co-written with Marc Laidlaw and Paul de Fillipo). As far as collections go, ""Gnarl!"" is becomingly introspective, and can be read as a transrealist autobiography. Rucker creates grim futures and funny scenarios that cover the spectrum of human emotion. Pac-Man addiction. Religious fervor. Microgravity sex. Beatniks and hydrogen bombs. Time warps and deranged aliens. ""Gnarl!'s"" got it all. You can't come away from the experience unmoved.",
"__label__2 Great headphones. Great value.: I think these have got to be the best headphones for the money out there. I've had mine about a year and an super pleased with them. From great sound, great comfort, I am very happy. I mainly got them to use on flights where I was sick of the engine noise breaking in to the music. I had been using some over ear headphones, but needed something smaller. Much smaller. Enter these sony's.I will concur with one review I read below - the rubber that houses the wires broke down on my and exposed the wires. Annoying, for sure, but I'm just getting another pair. It took them a year and a half of daily use for this to happen, so I am not concerned.",
"__label__2 Yet another 5 stars!: Been using this for many years now, still the best overallconditioner I have ever used. Leave it on for 10 minutes if youcan (per directions from years ago) for therapeutic results on hairand scalp.

"__label__1 Please skip this one: This is a piece of junk - the cars are supposed to hook together and be able to be dragged along by an 18 month old. The problem with this is, the cars don't LATCH together (they don't click into place) - they just set one car upon another. This means that when the child tries to pull the cars, he or she just ends up pulling the front car out, dumping the Winnie the Pooh character on the floor, and swinging the front car in the air. The ONLY way to get this to roll along on the floor is to pull the string along, parallel to the floor. The only child you could convince to do that would be older than 2, if not 3. And at that point, this toy is a little beneath them.Terrible, stupid design. I'm glad I got it as a gift, I would have hated to have spent any money on it.",
"__label__1 No Safety Seals???: I purchased this item to help ease my daughter away from her finger-sucking habit. However, when the product came, there is NO safety seal on the outside box, and NO safety seal on the bottle cap. As a result, I'm afraid to use the product for fear of tampering or tainting. It's shocking to me that a product aimed for finger-suckers and nail-biters, and on the box states ""An effective deterrent for adults and CHILDREN"" has absolutely no safety seals to ensure the product can't be tainted or tampered with, in the long line of distribution from manufacturer to consumer!!! Very disappointed.",

I bought all of the books in this series and am shocked at how much of the advice has been taken from previous authors on these topics. She is copying classics like Emily Post and simply re-wording the text. Except for the cute drawings, this series is a waste of money. If you want to know how to do things ""correctly"", read Letitia Baldridge's ""The New Manners For the '90's"". It covers everything and is written by a woman with the education and experience to know of which she speaks!

Manual focusing procedure is so cumbersome that it may as well not be there.I regret buying Minolta, better stick with Cannon A80 - better product better value.

I found that it is pretty effective at retrieving many deleted files, and does a better job than many other low-cost or free programs of this type. It even allows you to preview the files before restoring them. However, I am quite disappointed by the fact that the program cannot restore the original file and folder structures, or even the original names of the files themselves, which can create a great deal of confusion when it comes to sorting the restored files. Therefore, if these issues are of concern to you, I would recommend spending a bit more if necessary to buy software that provides these features.",

Unfortunately, she is also the reason why this 'trip down gore lane' can pass itself off as a serious film at first glance. It is, however, just another exercise in how far a filmmaker can push the envelope on the theme of cruelty, mayhem and murder. The only favorable point I can possibly give it is that the producers did not shy away from using an actress who, thankfully, is not trying to hide her age and is accepting the cycle of life with a grace that makes her even lovelier.",

The author of this medical fantasy story describes local neighborhoods and live experiences with focused accuracy. There is much to learn about piloting an airplane that is revealed by the author's vast knowledge of that subject but the relevance to the whole story escaped me. Perhaps, one must rise above all the details on the surface of the earth to see the whole picture and make such a seemingly simple but amazing medical discovery. The greatest asset of this book is to remind readers that helping mankind is much more important than the potential monitary reward associated with an invention or a discovery. The second most important asset of this book is the pure learning experience about historical facts from a very learned author.",

"__label__1 Terribly boring and unfunny: I found this movie extremely dull and laughed exactly one time. The ""comedy,"" if you really want to call it that, is beyond juvenile... and not even the funny juvenile humor that makes other movies good. Overused accents are very rarely funny, especially when they're so over accentuated (like in this film) that it gets to be annoying. How so many people liked this movie is beyond me, but it makes me think about how bad society is becoming.",

As the book neared the end I found myself wishing for it not to be over. I felt like I was right there going through the ordeal myself. Koontz pulled me in and has not let me go. I have read several other great books by him since, but none of them hooked me like Seize the Night.",
"__label__2 Terrific book!: I found this book to do just what I had hoped. It's like a syllabus from a very smart, highly organized professor, who fleshes out the subjects just enough, and lets you know where exactly to look for more. It's concise, intelligent, and informative, and it saved me a lot of time in working out an outline on the subject (I'm an art professor myself). Cynthia Freeland -- thank you! What clarity!",

"__label__1 Dim And Disappointing!!: What a waste of money. This is NOT an LED light, and does not come close to the performance of an LED light at half the price! Guess we're paying for the name and the lifetime warranty. This one will easily last a lifetime, sitting unused in a drawer. Bought it for my medical career wife (she likes purple) but it is clumsy for her to turn on, concentrate the beam, then turn off with one hand. Bought her a 99-cent tear-drop shaped keychain LED light on a whim and its perfect. Brighter and easier to use, replaceable battery, and 1/7 the cost. I really expected more from this company, but both this light and their customer perspective are obsolete. No complaint with the quality of construction. Solid aluminum and O-rings as usual. Just has the minor flaw of casting a weak and scattered beam, way below the performance of modern LED technology. The light is yellow and full of shadow artifacts that prevent a clean illumination. Not a good buy; don't repeat my mistake!",

"__label__1 Musical Kleenex: Joss Stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. I couldn't find a single memorable tune here. I also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, ""Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew."" I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's ""The Orange Album"" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut. Had Gwen Stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. It's new artists like Stefy that could keep the music business afloat. Are we listening Ms. Stone.",

This was a big waste of money not to mention how disappointed my daughter was. I would definately NOT recommend this kit for anyone.",
"__label__2 It's Interesting..: Werewolf was my first introduction to World of Darkness. I enjoyed it, but, reading the other books pointed out to me that Werewolves are definitely a better platform for Storytellers than players - they're either too weak or too powerful! New players will find themselves darting away from a vampire or hunter with any kind of experience, where as someone who actually finds standing in the Garou nation will be able to kill off Justicars and Femorachs without breaking a sweat.You could play a campaign, of course, but, it'll take some effort to make high-leveled characters keep interest. Buyer beware!",
"__label__1 What are these other reviews?: This controller is terrible. The only positive thing I could say about this controller is you can throw it at the wall and it won't break. The sticks are hard to move and don't allow for the pressure sensitivity required for enjoyable gaming. The buttons are stiff. The handles are big and uncomfortable. The included headset is uncomfortable to a grown adult. I didn't use the included headset after the first night. Overall, I would say move on to the next after market controller.",

Its really good that the price has dropped by about half however, I mean seriously.... This sure isn't Hamlet. The show is cheesy and cheap, but not in a bad way at all. I found it quite entertaining still. And it is really a treat to see the eternally classy and beautiful Lee Meriwether at what is perhaps the pinnacle of her elegance and grace.The show is more serious then, and far less classic then, Lost in Space or Batman. But it provides the same type of wholesome campy entertainment that has made those shows TV legends. If you don't like cheese however, look elsewhere.",

"__label__1 Beginning? Yeah Right...: This book is utterly useless for both a beginner like me, and someone who knows C++ well. All it does is explain what each function does rather than teaching you how to use it. In the 2nd chapter alone, there's a 200-line program of all OpenGL functions that you're expected to understand by about 3 pages of explanation. I'm a beginning programmer who knows a lot about C, but not everything, and this book isn't helping me at all. Also, I can tell that it doesn't teach you much, as the end of book game example is slow and buggy. Go learn C++ then get an online tutorial or reference page, don't waste the money on this book.",
"__label__1 Let's be honest...not that great.: I'm a little troubled by most of the reviews that I've seen for Groundation. It seems that all of these ""real reggae fans"" have overlooked the fact that this album is average at best. Bob, Steel Pulse, Midnite, Luciano, Don Carlos, we could go on forever, there is just too much GOOD reggae out there. Unfortunately ""We Free Again"" and everything else I've heard from Groundation just does not live up to the hype you'll see here in these reviews. Seriously, even John Brown's Body is better. Check out Midnite's RAS MEK PEACE if you want to hear some REAL reggae. I mean if you like Groundation, you'll wet your pants when you hear Midnite.if you want ""the real thing.""",
"__label__2 Silly, silly fun!: This is not a high-brow comedy, but neither is it the typical low-brow stuff being produced today that focuses on bodily functions and groin punches. This is British comedy, which means that it actually has some wit, in between the sight gags. If the comedy of Peter Sellers, the absurdity of Monty Python, and the sheer outlandishness of the Rocky Horror Picture Show appeal at all to you, then this movie will tickle at least one funny bone.",
"__label__2 An excellent resource for teachers, parents, and caregivers!: This book has many helpful, fun and task specific activities that work for children during their most formative years. I have found this book to be invaluable. The games are beneficial for teaching and reinforcing specific skills, and they are entertaining enough to keep kids interested. Most of all, the games really work! The games don't take much time or extreme effort, but they pay off extremely well. If you are the parent or teacher of young children, you will find yourself referring to this book again and again.",
"__label__1 Let's not confuse things.: Actually, I find the argument that these books should be judged simply on their own terms to be absurb, especially since the fabrication of JT Leroy was used to lure readers to the books in the first place. In other words, the books are fiction but the marketing device to get us to read them was a lie, pure and simple. So that's how these writings by Laura Albert should be understood--not as a stand-alone works of fiction but as a marketing tool to fool the public into buying them. If the hoax of JT Leroy shouldn't matter in regard to the books than why, I wonder, was it used in the first place?",

"__label__2 Worth the money!: This mat is definately worth the extra money. I practiced yoga five days a week for 4 months, blowing out one cheaper mat and causing significant signs of wear on the second one. Once this mat is broken in, I found it to not only be quite sticky, but also to provide excellent cushioning for me knees. It is also larger than most other mats, so there is less need to read just your position on the mat as frequently to avoid contact with others in a crowded yoga class.This mat is also excellent for those wanting to practice yoga at home on carpet. My other mats always slid around on my carpetted floor, but this one is heavy enough to stay put. If you are committed to a yoga practice, invest in this mat and you won't regret it. The only negative is that it is so heavy I would not necessarily recommend it to yogis that walk or bike to class.Namaste!",

The only thing that kept them from getting five stars is that they are on the bulky side likely due to the neoprene coating. I am female 5'7"" with long thin fingers. If my fingers were not on the longer side it may be hard to grip these well. They work for me, but I would be careful if you have tiny hands.",
"__label__1 NCV audio review: While this CD set is in a very nice carrying case with a magnetic clasp, and the sound is clear, unfortunately the background music (with an ocassion drum beat etc) is distracting, and, and for me personally, the person narrating it has a 'southern preacher' sound that I don't care for. If you prefer a southern preacher reading this and background music then you will really enjoy this. I'm used to Alexander Scourby with no music/dramatization, so this was a let down for me.",

Granted, it's not comprehensive, but it does give a good foundation in the theories behind modern Geography.If you are into Geography (with a capital-G) and not just geography, buy this book.

"__label__2 Best Western Ever: Gritty, dirty and downright manly. The overgrown adolescents of today need to study this film and learn how to act like a man. No tattoos, ear-rings or other piercings to smother the Y gene. Little music is used; some of the 40s and 50s flicks were embellished with over the top, histrionic scores combating rather than complimenting the plot. The dialogue is short, cutting and to the point. I especially like the ""he-girl"" comment. Another William Wellman masterpiece; get this film. DVD transfer is superb.",
"__label__1 Pretty but poor quality: The handle on the kettle is not connected very well and allows for a lot of ""bounce"" when you are lifting the kettle, traditionally instability is not something I look for when poring boiling water. Also, when you lift the lid you need to lift it from the top of the kettle and then immediately move it to the left or the right, since there isn't enough clearance (b/c of the handle) to remove the lid naturally.The color is nice and they did a nice job on the ombre effect.

Klempeler's reading is insightful and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra played so warm and powerful that I think it is better than the philharminia orchestra especially for its brass.

On initial install the Carb diameter hole was a bit to small so the flame arrestor would not fit onto the Carb flange. This was corrected with a Dremel tool, after a small bit of grinding it slid right into place. The next step was finding a threaded rod log enough so the arrestor could be secured to the carb, after a trip to NAPA (local auto supply store) that issue was also corrected. Finally fired the boat up yesterday on muffs and she purred like a kitten and looks good too. Cant give details on performance yet but I am hoping K&N claims are as accurate as they say.

"__label__2 Great for seniors & kids: We recently bought .Mac for our 90 year old mother, who loves email & surfing on her iMac, but needs a very stable, simple platform. She recently moved to an independent living apartment with high speed internet, but the provider does not provide email addresses and expects users to access web-based email, which we know is just too confusing & too many steps for our mother, who is very used to Apple Mail. Now she has a .mac address, completely integrated by the Apple OS, & it took less than 5 minutes. Yes, it's an expensive mailbox, but I'm so glad it is available.",

"__label__1 A Different Nikita: Fans of the current ""Nikita"" TV series should be warned that this earlier version of the show is much darker and more violent. From the end of Season 2 on, it takes a very different direction as Nikita gradually becomes a willing member of Section 1 (Division). Also, this show makes frequent use of graphic sadomasochistic themes, and there seems to be at least one torture scene in every episode. In fact, Section 1 often behaves more like the Gestapo than a rogue branch of the CIA. The suggestion here is that this is justified, and there is a strong neoconservative political undercurrent to the show. Many of the episodes end in tragedy, and I found this series to be a major turnoff. Two much better programs in this genre are ""Alias"" and ""MI-5."" I would recommend both of them over this show.",

Ooh, and the: ""My mom will kill me if she heard me tell one single dead baby joke"".I first purchased this book in 1988 to have on hand when my neices and nephew's visited me. I then lent it to a few people through out the years, I recently had to replace it because my children just plain wore the book out.",

I love my bass-hitting music and even turn it up so that I can hear my music from my bedroom while I'm in the shower. The bass has been blasted so loud with bass-test songs that shelves have emptied themselves all over my floor as well as multiple drinks having fallen off of my desk. This system located upstairs on the second floor makes the support columns located outside of my house by the front door vibrate when it is at 3/4 volume with bass all the way up. This is by far worth the 100$ and I was surprised to find out it has 200w RMS. I had been thinking it was atleast 500w RMS.GREAT BUY!

My favorite games were in the late 80's early '90s when game play was paramount over flashy graphics.I purchased this program after trying it out for a few weeks via Freeverse's website. This game is very similar to Activision's 80's version of Shanghai -- except that it's gorgeous to look at, has terrific gameplay, and is ...(insert drum roll here) ...loads of FUN!I prefer games that are easy to get into, and continue to hold my interest over time. This review would be 5 stars, but I took down one star because under MacOSX 10.3, I can't play any of the audio tracks on the game. Freeverse software has indicated that a patch will be made available soon.Highly recommended, especially for non-gamers that want a good, fun diversion every now and then.

They call this the tragic symphony but for me it was pure joy. I have watched some Berstein performances on DVD and to date I will take Abbaddo or Thielmann anytime....Those old video recordings do detract from my enjoyment of the pieces....and my musical training simply is not able to tell if one performance exceeds another.

The controls are AWESOME, the storyline and characters are CLASSIC, and overall it feels like you're playing a classic Western film as Clint Eastwood or John Wayne. The details get pretty gorey, though, with brain splatter, blood squirting, and dismemberment, so it's not for the faint of heart. The one thing that could be better is the length of the game.

However, the American perspective upon the subject provided by the authors is to be welcomed. Also welcome are the numerous photographs, beautifully capturing an educational ethos which is now, somewhat sadly, in decline. The limited number of stunning colour plates show how even more impressive the book would be if printed throughout in colour.

There is a complete teacher guide, practice problems, instruction for how to construct and use accelerometers, suggestions for making measurements, practice (at school) lab exercises, and a student workbook. The best part is the resources. This includes the excellent reprints from The Physics Teacher journal giving important background on the rides and experience. This compendium of reprinted articles alone is worth the price of the book.This book is a must, and can be used with other books and texts.",

He also trashes everyone Ducky knewto make her look better. Sullivan's treatment of the murderedEmpress Alexandra is particularly cruel and unnecessary. Bottomline: Ducky was an overrated, frumpy, greedy historical footnote.Cyril wanted to be Emperor, so why didn't he start by executingtraitors like himself and his wife?

Basically, a cat named Mewsette(Judy Garland) leaves her devoted friend, Jeane Tom, and her home on the farm. She wants to go to Paris. When she gets there, she is tricked by the bad guy, Meowrice. Jeane Tom and his buddy Robespierre spend most of the movie looking for Mewsette. I won't tell you any more because that would spoil it. This movie is absolutely hilarious! I find myself rolling every time I watch it! The only thing I don't like about it is when Meowrice sings. Aaah! It is really wierd. I wish they would change the title, though. Well, times have changed and you don't want kids running around saying ""Gay Purr-ee."" Other wise, it is a great movie!",

Each of these episodes are cut at around 30-34 minutes, but when they air on nbc only 21 minutes can be shown. So these deleted scenes are just basic ""extra"" scenes... they're actually as funny as the regular show... so it's a great bonus.

My original is tall and slender, with thick glass. The new version is short, wide and the glass is thinner. I don't know if this makes a difference, but my problem is thus: When pouring liquid, my new Measuring Cup DRIPS. The spout allows liquid to escape down the outside of the container, often outside my bowl. This is not what I'm looking for when attempting to achieve an exact amount of any ingredient needed in a recipe. However, Pyrex is Pyrex.

"__label__2 Best New Artist: I think it unfair to Ms. Keyes that anyone would compare her to Res, who is so much more womanly and connected to her musical style than Alicia. The Res debut is more cohesive, weaving lyrics and production into a nearly seamless cloth. Even the track listing seems ordered to further your listening pleasure. Aside from the bonus track, which I have to be in the mood for, ""How I Do"" is very much a plug-and-play CD, in contrast to the highly skippable and aptly-titled ""Songs in A Minor"". With Alicia, much as with Aaliyah, there is a disjoint between her startling vocal ability and her production, in Alicia's case an underdeveloped over-synthesized jangle that does nothing to compliment her behind the piano. Alicia's debut is teeny-bop pop and does not reach me on an adult level.I recommend buying Res now and giving Alicia a little time to grow up.",

I am really glad that they turned it into more of a political and psychological thriller instead of just us having to watch Alice and Co. run around killing mindless zombies.

The lighting is blue or brown. The soundtrack is the same minor-chord piano riff over and over again.

__label__2 LOVE IT!: I love this wine cooler. Prior to buying this wine cooler my wine was stored in cardboard boxes in the spare bedroom. This wine cooler is beautiful. Stainless steel door frame and black body make this wine cooler look sleek and elegant. It is so small it hardley takes up any space which is good because I live in a tiny 1000 sq ft condo. The fan is totally silent. I never hear it running. Why did I wait so long to buy it?The cooler only cools to 54 F. So white wines will still have to be chilled before drinking. The maximum ambient temperature for this wine cooler is 77 F. So it cannot be placed in a garage. The door opens from left to right. I am not sure it can be reversed like with refrigerators. One final drawback - champagne bottles will not fit unless a rack is removed.All in all a great bargin.,

When I removed it the image was perfect again. I do not recommend this filter. Buy the Nikon 52mm NC filters. Much better!!",

This telephone uses very unique power supply - 6VAC there is no way to find it anywhere. Manufacturer's web site is utterly useless. Customer service 800 numbers are backed up, representatives based i India or who knows where and offer very limited help if any, most likely they will send you to a Sears or RadioShack store. Yes this is a discontinued model but not that old and this lack of support raises concern for the current line of products from Thompson, GE and RCA - once they become discontinued are they to be junked?

"__label__2 A Helpful Introduction to Benner's Short-Term Model: Dr. David Benner presents the case for his short-term, five-session model for pastoral counseling with succinctness, clarity, fairness, and sound argumentation. In addition, he goes to great lengths to explain how such a model could work effectively within a church setting. The last three chapters are especially practical in their step-by-step presentations of the strategic pastoral counseling model and two well-presented case studies. His discussion of the inherently spiritual nature of many life issues (pp.62-67) is a very helpful and profound elucidation of the pastoral counselor's role. I highly recommend this volume to all pastors of local churches and all practicing or aspiring Christian counselors.",
"__label__1 Acceptable, but don't waste your money: This book has a couple of useful recipes, but too much sugar and too many carbs.However, more important, the religious overtones - primarily in the opening chapters - completely undermine the authority of the authors. The blatant suggestion to ""pray rather than treat"" is both insulting and dangerous. In addition, the link to some fly-by-night religious help group is irritating. Praying about your condition might make you feel better, but when my health is at stake I go to a Medical professional rather than making a wishful appeal to an imaginary helper in the sky.There are better, and more credible books out there.",

The only way I would trust that is was square would be to use a right angle to check for square. Mine was hard to set at 90o using just my hands (does not rotate smoothly). However, when using it, it would be easy for the saw to push it slightly out of alignment because there is no way to lock it at a set angle.Elimination of the 90o alignment holes/dimples and the addition of some kind of real lock that was accurate would be good.",

Elva was in the movie for no more than a total of 5 minutes. Then why is she on the cover? Hey, sex sells. Slap a hot girl on the cover of anything and it'll sell.

THeir lyrics were better, the attitude somewhat different, the musicianship also better and harder. Of course they profited over the whole MTV videos vibe of the time, but that was a natural course to follow, unfortunately.STAY HUNGRY is one hell of a strong album.

Crippled by disease, the child ponders the small beauties of life that offset her plight.

"__label__1 Not Science Fiction. Boring. Couldn't get through it.: Robert A.

These powers, as of page 333, are not explained. There is hardly any conflict in story, and the conflicts that are presented are written with little skill or passion. Smith dispatches enemies in the action scenes by making them disappear without effort. During negotiations, Smith's lawyer steamrolls the opposition.

I really didn't think it would work as well as it did.The active ingredients are vitamin C (60% RDA), Zinc (50% RDA), Echinacea, Eucalyptus, and stevia. Other ingredients are peppermint, licorice, roasted chicory, natural menthol extract, lavender and Chinese star anise.

There are too many books on the market that read the same and have the same information on metal clay. My advise, free tutorials on the net are the best way to learn. Not only are the books on the market the same on metal clay, but do all of the authors have to word their instructions on every single move that their hands make?

"__label__2 music for the millenium: As the millenium approaches, music must prepare itself for the inevitable change of the ages. And with those changes there must be a new force to spearhead the change. This force has a name and it's Tommy Henriksen. From the worldly sounds and hip-hop beat of the opening track ""If I Could"", to the atmospheric and emotion-drenched ender ""Heaven Only Knows"" this cd is the soundtrack to a culture in metamorphosis. But all the while maintaining a fresh pop sensibility, the songs are just so damn catchy- try getting them out of your head. Quite a feat, and especially for a new artist. Where has this guy been? Suggested tracks for surreal ear candy, the blissful ""Beyond Life"" [with cameo by avant-rocker Nina Hagen], ""Dreaming in Colors"", and the African chant-anthem ""Uneasy Street"". Then for an upbeat flavor is the celtic-fueled ""One Voice"", and the seductive stirrings of ""When She Comes"". This is an absolute must!",

I can keep my headphones from getting tangled, and it only takes about five seconds to get them back in the case.My only real gripes are that the cord is only a meter, far too short if you want to have any freedom of movement when listening. Also, they pop out of your ears too easily, especially because they're short. However, such a problem is minor considering the price and quality of these ear buds.",
"__label__2 Im in my Element!: Hearing this sound at ""Q"" in Adelaide made me only do one thing- go out and buy it. Why you ask, 'cos i was in my element.

"__label__1 Very dissapointing: We can call it a road atlas. However, in that field it fails. Poor, difficult to read mapping (like white roads on very light gray background), plenty of empty space, no small roads, no coordinates grid, no relief shading or coloring, only limited amount of interesting places marked on the maps etc. I bought it in hopes I could use it for Africa overland travels, but it is way too limited. Very nice concept but poor implementation. If you only want to drive through ""highways"" and are on budget then this atlas may be somewhat useful, but probably Michelin Africa regional maps 741, 745 and 746 at 1:4.000.000 scale are better investment. It contains some maps of national parks and town that may be useful. Southern part of this atlas is advertised as 1:1.000.000 scale, however that does not mean it has more details! Actual mapping in this atlas is done by South African company Map Studio and their other atlases are same low mapping standard as well.",

I had already spent hundreds of dollars with Havahart so I checked out their competition, Scarecrow. Finally I got a product that works without consistently breaking down.

"__label__2 Basic Leadership Principles with Excellent Examples: This book was an enjoyable, practical and applicable read. Phillips outlines a number of basic leadership principles and uses relevant examples from Abraham Lincoln's time as Commander in Chief during the Civil War. This book will be enjoyable both for Lincoln fans and those looking for basic concepts of leadership.The book is broken down into four areas: People, Character, Endeavor, and Communication with sub-chapters that further support each area. Each sub-chapter is synopsized with summary bullets called ""Lincoln Principles"" that highlight the cogent thoughts of that section.""Lincoln on Leadership"" is a good primer to provide a basic overview of leadership principles, and will not be useful for teaching about advanced leadership topics. However, Phillips' use of relevant examples from Lincoln's life made the book applicable to a number of leadership scenarios and made this book very enjoyable.",

Skaarsgard does make a pretty convincing younger version of Father Merrin, some 25 years before the events in the first Exorcist, and like Father Karras, has his own crisis of faith from his WWII days as a priest in Nazi Europe.

"__label__2 Probably the scariest pirate story ever: I was not expecting much when I started to read this book. I have a mostly unfounded fascination for contemporary cultural images of piracy, and I wanted to get this under my belt to earn a little street cred. Turns out, it's amazing. It took me a couple of chapters to pick up the rhythm and vocabulary of Stevenson's style, but once I was able to focus on the story itself, I didn't want it to end. Stevenson does a brilliant job of portraying pirates for the criminals that they were, mostly by viewing them through the eyes of an innocent young boy, who overhears a dark conversation while hiding in an apple barrel and also spends a tense scene trying to escape his home with his mother before the bad guys materialize out of the misty night to kill them both for treasure.

I don't feel like I learned much about them that was particularly interesting or unexpected, and the book feels padded. Two, Sullivan is a lousy writer. His prose is rambling and disorganized. He makes spelling errors, misuses words, uses tenses in disagreement, and more. Was this book even edited, I wondered? I doesn't seem like it. The yarns he spins to pad the book are not very interesting and tend to petter out without going anywhere. He wrote a book about himself writing a book about rats, and it's not a good one.",
"__label__1 Solipsistic Foolishness: She croons the album title, ""Oops I did it again"" with a fake sincerity. I should say this of the whole album.There is missing a sincerity and intelligence that was definitely audible on her first album. Before her lyrics had force and what gave it that was its ambiguity, its unwillingness to tow the line. The old Brittany would never have given into corporate pressure or public opinion. So no she did not do it again.She seems to be more selfish than ever with words that refer always to herself. That's usually okay, but she has lost some picture of who she really is. Who is the ""I"" in ""I did it again""? Clearly it's not the ""me"" in ""Baby, hit me one more time.""I was disppointed with this album, though I believe in her. I believe that she can see what she has become and learn that she has lost that wiseful innocence and become privy to something less. Though I must admit there were a couple songs that made me cry.",

With a small band and a small house it is at its best. However, when making the move to the screen almost all of what made The Fantasticks the longest running musical is lacking. It is unfortunate, for the location and house sets are almost perfect for the show. But the characterizations are skewed and lacking, and changes made for this movie almost always moves it away from the charming stage classic.Musical numbers are eliminated, and the shows best known song, Try to Remember, is included briefly at the end as an afterthought that it had to be represented.There are some things that work here, and if you have not seen the show you may even enjoy it.

"__label__2 Trapse Around Paris with Hemingway!: Hemingway is one of my favorite novelists. Fortunately, he is as terrific a non-fiction writer as he is a fiction writer.He shows you a Paris that was so full of life, and opportunity; You can immediately see why American writers flocked there in droves in the twenties.In this book, the writing is so good that you feel that you are drinking in the quaint Parisian bars until all hours, and that you, too, are drinking in all the sights and scenes of the most inspiring city in the world at that time.Also, from his friendship with Gertrude Stein to the guilt he felt after an adulterous affair, Hemingway holds back nothing.For two years I lived in Oak Park, IL, where Hemingway was born and raised. The community has made the house he lived in a museum honoring him, and holds a Hemingway festival. I sorely miss living there; it certainly isn't Paris back in Hemingway's time (what is?!)but it is wonderful to have a museum to such an adventurous American writer.",

So beware if you are thinking on purchasing this book and look at the dates on the reviews. I should have guessed these reviews were false d/t the 11 five star reviews. Come on! Not one person gave it less? I tried to find something else she had written and was unable to. Probably because the publisher wasn't going to take a chance on losing more money.",
"__label__2 It's the BEST!: Originally I had the aluminum cups that were not double lined and they did not keep anything cold and all they did was sweat all over everything. We were going to Hawaii and I knew I just had to find a better solution. So I gave these a try. OMG!!! The are the BEST cup ever. We would put water, soda, flavored water - whatever - in the cup in the morning with some ice. Then drive around all day and leave the cups in a car that was over 100 degrees and by the end of the day the beverage was still ice cold and the ice had not even melted all the way. Absolutely amazing. You just can't go wrong. Easy to drink from, no sweating - it is perfect. I am keeping these babies under lock and key when our son comes over and wanders off with the hodge-podge of cups and glasses we have, never to be seen again.",
"__label__2 Small but well designed: This is one of the smaller Brita pitchers. Every morning, after water for the cat, the dog, and my pills, it needs a refill. The great part is, no need to remove the top to add water. A small section of the lid tilts up for refills. No fingerprints, no smudges, no problems. It is small enough to fit anywhere in the refrigerator, door or shelf. Who cares about continuous refills is you don't have to remove the lid and then clean the mess.Also a really easy to use calendar to keep track of 8 weeks between filter changes.",
__label__1 Damaged In Route: I recieved the item and it was dammaged. I believe that this occured in route but do not know. The original merchant replaced item free-of-charge.,
"__label__1 Just Awful!: Each season in this boxed set has numerous defective disks. Some freeze, some won't play at all. Very disappointing and frustrating. Amazon customer service was exceptional, however, and allowed the return of this defective product even after the 30-day refund period. Since then, I have ordered the ""Will and Grace 1-8 Seasons Bundle Pack"" from one of their independent vendors and am extremely pleased with the service and, more importantly, the quality of the dvds. The individual seasons just take up more room on the shelf ... small price to pay for having the shows play smoothly!",
"__label__1 An affordable piece of garbage: I bought one of these and I can tell you unequivocally that it does not work. This is not the report of a neophyte to computers or audio equipment; I know both, and this unit does not do the job.

"__label__1 Save Your Money: This flick is just gosh awful! I had such high hopes for it, given thecast, but the film is totally sabotaged by poor direction.R. Downey Jr. mumbles nearly all of his lines with a cigarette in his mouth, so don't count on understanding him. Other characters rival hismumbling as well. The film is too long, should have been edited down to2 hrs max. Too many subtitles are so miniscule as to be illegible most of the time. And the lighting? Just awful. Too bad this work which had potential is such a failure!",
__label__1 Not so good..........: I loved BR movie and would tell all my friends about it. But this....This is crap. For some reason I just had to read the first 3 books but now I have officialy stoped reading. The character development is very good but one thing that keeps this from being good. ITS WAY TO GRAPHIC FOR ITS TASTE! I know it says Mature on the back but still jeez! I mean you see some much brains and intestince get shot or pulled out. For an example Shuyas orphin brother gets shot in the cheek and you see a graphic picture of him laying on the ground with a huge whole with his tung sticking out. And than the teacher finishes him off by shooting him between the eyes. Its extreamly violent. And when you get to the last chapter on this lets just say if your into Hardcore Pornagraphy than you'll like this. This book went waaay overboard. But its in your taste what you like. All I know Is I've stoped.The novel and Movie is really good!BATTLE ROYALE 2 was not that good.Later.........,
"__label__1 Wouldn't recommend it: Bought it as a spare to always have one battery ready to play while charging the 2nd one. I charged it twice without any problems with myXbox 360 Quick Charge Kitand on the third time I noticed the lights on the charging Kit wouldn't turn on, as in there wasn't any battery in it. Left it overnight without the charging kit lights on but just as I suspected it didn't charge one bit. I've googled a lot trying to find a solution but haven't found one. What I did find was that other customers have the same charging problem. Very dissapointed.EDIT: Forgot to mention, I also experienced what other reviewers have written. This battery is a bit larger than the original microsoft one and it has to be forced a little bit into the controller. I didn't pay much attention to this the two times I used it because I was happy that it was working properly. Have read in other pages that in time it can actually break the controller so also take this into consideration before buying this product.",

"__label__2 Mach II Never Fails: Let me make this plain and clear. This is a classic Mach II Deep Purple CD. That being said, if you like In Rock, Fireball, Machine Head, Who Do We Think We Are?, Perfect Strangers and House of the Blue Light then you will LOVE this CD. The lyrics are clever, the guitar is classic Blackmore and the rhythm section of Paice, Lord and Glover is as solid as ever. The production is crisp and what more do you need? Never get tired of listening to Anya, Twist in The Tale, Ramshackle Man and Nasty Piece of Work. Nothing wrong with the other tracks *(except One Man's Meat) either. With the garbage that passes as rock these days you owe it to yourself to hear some ""real"" rock Gods. Deep Purple Mach II are among the best. I promise you won't be disappointed.",
"__label__2 Still going strong one and a half years later!: I bought this as a gift for my daughter, who at the time was just about to turn 3. From day one she has loved it! I can honestly say that she would not love learning as much as she does now if it weren't for the LeapPad!The purple and pink was a great idea from the manufacturer, she was barely interested in the green and blue.In addition to the LeapPad, the organizers and books make it a tight system. It's very difficult to lose cartridges with the organizer.It's also very stable, it's been dropped, hanged (by the pen/cord), written on and RAINED ON and it's still working flawlessly. The pages are laminated so they don't get damaged or torn either!Overall this is the BEST purchase I've made for my daughter yet. If you want your child reading and doing math quickly and having fun while learning, GET THIS NOW!",

It's the best book that'll help you learn the basics and all the grammar of the language of the Klingon Empire. I rate this book 5x2 stars. It's the best Klingon dictionary Okrand ever made!

"__label__1 I'm in tears!: I started with Quicken version 1.0 and was delighted. Each upgrade was like going to the candy store to see what great features were added. The last great version of Quicken was 6.0. Since then, each upgrade has been a disappointment. There are memory leaks that prevent using the product for over 8 hours on my computer before hanging and having to reboot (Quicken99). I was thinking of upgrading to Quicken2003, but after reading the reviews, I am at a loss. I think I'll just go back to Version 6.0 and be happy again!Old versions had no advertising.",
"__label__2 good advice, if you can follow it: There are things here about the psychology of people who are shy, different kinds of shyness, some root causes, things you can do about it, how to not raise shy kids, and some benefits of being shy (e.g. tend to do good work that would be hard for flighty or gregarious people -- intense research, etc.)The co-author is a psychologist or psychiatrist, and probably contributed the theories.My only complaint was that being shy was occasionally refered to as selfishness in other clothes.All in all, there is some good advice but it didn't change my life or anything.",

"__label__2 Very Nice Pen Set: Let me say first up, if you're looking for a professional pen set, look somewhere else. That aside, this is a pretty good amateur set.This pen set comes with 8 assorted pens, as advertised. One is a ""thin"" felt tip (thicker then most ball tip pens), a medium felt tip pen, and 6 marker tip pens, which are only different from each other thanks to the ink tone, which ranges from light gray to pure India Ink black.If you're not used to drawing with pens, this is a great set to start out with. Practice a bit, and you'll be making some fine art in no time. If you're more on the experienced side, well, you don't really need ME to tell you what to do.Haven't been able to tell if they're refillable or not. The back end rotates, but I'm too scared of making a huge mess to try to pull it off. Guess I'll find out when the ink runs out in one of them, but this is a great value either way.",

The problem is that not only are you unable to play it on newer computers, it also has some type of spyware on it that creates havic with desktop images and other visuals. It resulted in a costly repair. Had I known that it does not work well with windows xp (which it says it does) I would have never purchased the product. Maybe the ispy manufacture needs to find a better way to enter into the 21st century. I had the same problem with ""can you see what I see?""

"__label__1 Can't believe the previous reviews: I'll begin by saying that my cats have a voracious appetite. They are under a year old. 10 months? They can eat an enormous variety of food. For this reason I was flabbergasted that they (both) smelled the food and walked away! Then I tried mixing it with a dry cereal that they love, NOPE, that didn't work either. So i allowed a good 20 hours go by without feeding them and again nothing. They would have starved before eating this stuff. The packaging is also what got me. They threw in a couple of cans they were dinged up and no labels. You couldn't place those on a store shelf, but hide them in the box for an unsuspecting online customer? Sorry can't rate this even one star. The worst part is I have another shipment this time ""chicken and liver"" from the same company. I'm praying.",

This is what the Co-Pastor at my church is using in her women's season bible study. Michelle is such an awesome author because she is so serious about being an instrument of righteousness for the Lord and she basically is saying in this book that if you want to be blessed and highly favored in the sight of our heavenly Father than you have to seek Him early, seek Him reverently, seek Him prayerfully and seek Him as if nothing else on earth really matters. This book lets you know that those of us who half step with the Lord as far as being in His will , will always be half blessed. I strongly recommend all of her books. Michelle, I thank God for you and your ministry and continue to be blessed and highly favored.",

"__label__1 Cheap packaging results in damage to discs: Great series but the packaging is sub-standard and many of the DVDs are scratched and scuffed, even when the product is bought new. The DVDs are housed in cardboard sleeves and it is very apparent that this is causing the scuffing and damage. Just as many others have complain, my entire season 3 is damaged to the point that it won't play on any DVD player. HBO should be ashamed of themselves and should provide replacements for the damaged discs. However, I have not had any success in getting a replacement.I would highly recommend avoiding this product, especially when you can purchase the seasons individually at a lower overall price. If you do buy it, remove all discs as soon as you receive them and place them in a ""real"" CD case with padded sleeves to prevent further damage.",
"__label__1 I liked this book as much as cellulite: While Oz and co. might have some useful advice, good diet tips and groundbreaking news for anyone battling their weight - the book is practically unbearable to read. It is so wrought with lame jokes, bizarre cliches, cheesy metaphors and otherwise unfunny attempts at humor that I just couldn't stand it. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that there are more than three or four of these types of inclusions on every page. I don't know why a respected doctor would litter his book and obscure his message with gratuitous (and lame) jokes.I'm all for information the ""Average Joe"" can comprehend and a dieting book that isn't a drag to read, but seriously, this is a right mess. The editor should be banished to the comic book wing of his firm!I am giving this two stars instead of one because I believe Oz does have some decent information for overweight people.",

With a single-minded determination, Lynnde manages to go from one bad relationship (I use the term lightly!) to the next, only finding solace in food. As her emotions run the gamut, so does her weight. Will Lynnde ever find the love she so desperately wants?There is no denying that Hudson knows how to draw readers into a story. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to jump into the pages of this book to either hug or hurt Lynnde. Hudson weaves a story that is both fresh and familiar.

If you're a beginning bassoonist and you're looking for a good reed, look elsewhere -- a bassoonist will only play as well as their reed allows them to, and Jones reeds will only hold you back.If you have no other alternatives locally, then I'd suggest finding a quality, reputable reedmaker online, because these reeds are simply poorly constructed.",

The original German is displayed opposite Bly's translations; you can get a sense of what got ""lost in translation"" even if, like myself, you don't speak a word of German.Bly's ruthless honesty shines through every page of the book. Though his translations are incredibly luminous, he clearly admits their limits:""...Rilke's elaborate and thoroughgoing labor on sound cannot be conveyed. In English his poems sound colorless.

It spends the majority of its time on a shelf, but it does get some play from my friends' kids. The balconies and such seem to be made to ""break away"" and fall apart rather than actually snap off, but the kids seem to learn real quick how to put it back together. Based on other reviews though, I suspect that Hasbro released this toy a little too early, without a decent amount on consumer testing.

All of the back and forth she does with I want you, I don't want you, I want you, I don't want you just killed this book for me. I could not get past it. I am all for strong heroines who stand up for their rights but she got rather ridiculous. I am affraid Ms. Mason overwrought her on that.

"__label__1 Unrealistically inaightful: Fiona Cheng is an eleven year old American girl with a Chinese father and a Scottish mother. She is ""half and half"" as she puts it, but is starting to realize that her identity is more complicated than two halves making a whole. Performing in her town's folk festival, Fiona wants to represent both of her halves but scheduling conflicts cause her to have to choose a side. Fiona's solution to her problem helps her realize that everyone has something different to offer about their own unique identity. Namioka's chapter book depicts a struggle to fit in that her readers will relate to, however her reflections on being biracial are at times too perceptive. Fiona's sophisticated musings on her racial identity sound more like a parent's contemplation on her mixed race child than her own. Written in a sometimes tediously moralizing tone, biracial readers of Half and Half may not find a character they can truly identify with.",
"__label__1 A Walk to Remember: The first Nicholas Sparks book that I read was The Notebook. What a wonderful novel, which pulled me along and kept me reading right through to the end nonstop. Then came Message in a Bottle. I really enjoyed it, too. Not quite as much as the first book, but it definitely had its good points. Unfortunately, A Walk to Remember truly disappointed me. I don't know if it was the tacky setup in the prologue which told me that he was planning to manipulate my emotions right from the start or if it was just the story itself. I didn't laugh. I didn't cry. I believe Mr. Sparks does a much better job of telling a story when he is NOT doing it with the sole intent of emotional maneuvering. I read it and found myself thinking that my 12-year-old daughter might enjoy it when I finished it.",

Both Tina and Evelyn are great, heart wrenching characters and every success and failure feels like a direct reflection upon a secret life only you know you ever lived. However, despite this being such an amazingly written book I was frustrated to find that the ending felt like there was something more that should have been written but somehow had been forgotten during publishing. This could possibly just be my own feelings and I still highly recommend this read. I look forward to reading her other books and maybe down the road she'll revisit Evelyn and Tina and hopefully things will have continued looking up for them.",

It was not Phoenix Gold. It was not gold plated and it was not 2 meter. It was ""bottom-of-the-line"" cable. Plus or rather minus quality of connection by this cable was pretty bad. Looks like cable was simply defective. Typical bite and switch case.",
"__label__2 Wow what a fence!: I've owned the Dewalt since it first came out. So far I haven't had any trouble with it. I cut oak, walnut, etc. without any problems. This isn't a cabinet saw, so don't expect it to cut through thick materials all day. It works fine for about anything else. The miter that came with the saw is pretty cheap, I replaced it with a better one. My only complaint with the saw is that the blade is so close to the front edge that it makes cross-cuts on anything wider than 4 or 5 inches a hassle. It does have the best fence adjustment system that I have ever used. After you have used the Dewalt rack&pinion fence system you won't want to use anything else. My advice...if this is your only saw save your money and buy a bigger more powerful one like the Delta Platinum. If you lack space or need portability, this is a nice saw.",
"__label__2 Wow, I'm Impressed: I had owned for several years a Kenmore dehumidifier. It was so loud it literally ROARED and you could feel it vibrating the floor upstairs. It did it's job, but it ran constantly and I'm sure was a total electricity hog.I got my new Goldstar refurbished, in the original box, well packed and ready to just plug in.I turned it on and all I can say is WOW. This thing is whisper quiet. The blower on my furnace makes 20x more noise than this thing does. I set the humistat at the midway point and walked away. Less than 20 hours later, I noticed it was dutifully shut off and waiting for me to empty the bucket. No overflows. The bucket has a great handle on it that makes it super easy to carry with no splashing. The unit itself is on casters and moves around with one finger.I am very pleased with this unit and would definitely recommend it.",
"__label__2 Great no spill mug.: I have been using this mug for about 3 months now. I really like it alot although there are just one concern... The rubber O-ring on the lid that is essentially the spill proofing comes off the lid VERY easily if you are not careful when hand washing, therefore allowing your beverage to spill all over your car seat as it did mine. Now that I'm aware of this it hasn't been a problem since. Also, the claim of 8 hours of keeping your coffee hot is not realistic unless you work in a heated area. If you work in the cold it will go for about 2 or 2- 1/2 hours. The one thing that I didn't like before ordering is that it is only 16oz. HOWEVER, what I have found is that now my coffee is staying very hot for a longer period is that I drink it slower & the 16oz is sufficient. Overall It is the best mug I have owned & would definately recommend!",
__label__1 Badly in need of editing: I really expected to love this book. The main character was growing up through my growing years. We seemed to have so much in common. I tried to like the book as I pondered through too many pages. But it rambled on and on and on. It could really be a good book if it were edited....tightly. I thought it would never end!,
"__label__1 Not the classic Thomas anymore.: My sixteen month old son loves Thomas & Friends. This new ""improved"" version is fully computer generated. As soon as he saw their mouths moving he FREAKED OUT and cried until I turned the DVD off. I don't recommend buying these newer DVD's for smaller children. It may be cool for older kids but it's frightening for youngsters who are used to the classic Thomas series. It's a shame they had to ruin it.",
"__label__1 DRAT, so disappointing, DON""T BUY THIS, ZERO stars: NO RADICAL INDEX OR CHARACTER CHART, that sums it up and then some. If you don't know what you're looking for, you won't find in here.

Sorry, but this thing is useless, spend your money on something that will actually be of use like Langenscheidt's.",
__label__1 Not worth it: This book started out ok but as you go through the entire length it becomes obvious the main character is wimpy and someone I did not admire. She became so dependent on her best friends' fiancee that she stopped being herself. It ended well but I will definitely not be reading any more by this author.,

"__label__1 the world has gone mad: Please stop the madness and the hype. Jay Z, Jigga, Shawn C. whatever moniker you choose to address him by - should have stayed in retirement. He missed with this one and tried to compensate with an entourage of A list producers.

By the way, the reviewer who said Jerry sold the rights to a song for a Vans commercial should remember that Only had to give up the rights to older Misfits songs to Danzig in order to bring back the band so the 'sell out' in that case would not be Jerry. I think the whole 'sell out' idea is inane, but wanted to clarify that. Who cares about a Vans ad? This is a great CD! Pick up the box set to while you are at it. You can't go wrong with the Misfits stuff on this site.",

"__label__1 Horrid Version: If you are a fan, avoid the DERAM versions at all cost. If you are new to the Moody Blues music, then get whatever version you can to just experience the experience.Unfortunely, the Deram discs (at least the ones I have) suffer from a bad mix. Sounding muted at the dynamic tracks, and then way over the top on surround stage with no center stage on other tracks. (of course I know it was recorded on quad to begin with, but how can you almost completely lose some of the spoken parts?)I've heard much better from lesser disks on lesser systems.Point being that this is supposed to be a ""better"" version.

"__label__2 Very Interesting, but Rather Tabloid-y: This is an excelent chronicle of one of history's greatest climbers. Because it presents both sides of the story, this book is worth a read. Contains scientific data as well as multitudes of tabloid-ish material. However, because it does, it tells the whole story. Marco Pantani, while an outstanding athlete, was the Britney Spears of Italian Cycling. This book captures that scene well!",
"__label__1 Waaay too small: The sizes on this outfit really do run quite small. We had a wedding to go to and wanted our little guy to look cute. The outfit was on him, a little snug, but our son is in the 95 percentile for height so we are accustomed to things not quite fitting (we typically leave a button or two undone or something). This outfit seemed fine while I had my son laying on his back and all buttoned up. But when I picked him up he started turning red in the face and couldn't breathe. I ripped the clip on bow-tie off immediately and he immediately gasped a huge breath and started crying. Of course I felt awful for forcing the outfit on ... I layed him down to start taking the outfit off when he pealed into another scream... the suspenders had come lose in back and the metal had dug into his skin (even through the shirt). I should have bought the 9 month size for my 3 month old!! I felt aweful and my poor son felt worse.",

"__label__2 Catchy Tunes!: Yes, she's definitely the Queen of Retro-Dance. ""Good Girl"", ""Favorite Things"", ""Kiss it all Goodbye""..... are among my favorites that I used to play all the time. Stacey's got a great soothing voice that just makes you feel good and want to dance, but she can do slow songs just as well. I personally like Better Than Heaven more that Hard Machine, because I really liked the tracks that were NOT ""hits."" A great album to me is one where quality of the ""other"" songs (the ones that didn't make in the charts)add to the overall enjoyment and value (their not just ""fillers""). All in all, Hard Machine is a great album with catchy tunes you will enjoy!Take a listen and you'll be singing along.I saw her in person back in the mid 80's........and she really puts on a show!!

"__label__2 A Priceless Investment: In a world of relativism and unbridled inclusiveness, we need a clear understanding of God's Word. It is life changing. The Bible does not contain but is the absolute truth of God. As one studies God's Word in the original languages (in this case NT koine Greek), untold treasures are revealed concerning what the Lord has for those who believe. We get a better understanding of the mind of God, the value of life and the salvation that every soul needs through Jesus Christ. I highly recommend it.",

In this chapter, the heroes (levels 9-10) must journey across the Blood Sea of Istar, to end the legacy of the Dark Queen once and for all! A glorious endquest to the epic adventure.",

My genuine IBM PATA hard drive adapter has a FRU P/N of 62P4553. The same P/N on the fake SATA bay adapter, not the 40Y8725 P/N called out in the product description.

I kept reading only the hope that they would both come to a horrible end, but was disappointed even there. There is no deeper meaning or startling insights here. The characters had absolutely no redeeming features and the ending was contrived and resolved nothing. We don't need to read about people like this, there are enough crazies in the real world. It's the second of Banks' books I have read, and will definitely be the last.",

Although I was never a Die-hard Nazareth fan, I remember really liking the RAZAMANAZ album. The Lead singer Dan McCafferty hasn't lost much voice, it may have gotten a little raspier. Pete Agnew, the Bass player has his Son playing Drums in the Band, and the kid does play well. I may have liked Manny Charleton's style a little better than the guitar player they have now, but this guy holds his own, and does a good job.",

This movie goes from bad to worse and then gets even worse. What is this movie about? Is there a point? It made no sense to me, seems to me that it's an Angsty movie about teenage angst, with extra angst and more teenage angst thrown in just to make it more Angsty. I kept trying to find a good spot in this film or at least something that would indicate what was going on, never happened. Apparently the director was smoking 'pregnant guppies' while he was filming, because this movie makes no sense at all, and probably wouldn't get better (even if you smoked a 'pregnant guppy').

They take place in El Hazard, which is a very colorful, imaginative (""lternative"" world. The opening and closing songs are great Japanese pop songs, and the incidental music is fun and original. I'm fairly new to the Anime scene, really only familiar with Hayao Miyazaki's features (the Disney of Japan, search for ""ayao Miyazaki""in VHS).

I never cared much for the ""horn bands"" of the early 70's, like Chicago or Blood, Sweat & Tears. However, the Flock was different and had a edge to them that was quite appealing. Unfortunately, the Flock got little commercial exposure and usually played alot of the festivals going on at the time. The Flock was more appreciated by other musicians than by the average listener. The funny thing is when people saw them live, they usally liked them. It goes to show you success is not just measured by talent or the Flock would have been at the top of the ladder. The Flock's style is a mixture of Rock, Jazz, Classical & Folk that creates a sound that is raw and polished at the same time. The Flock is one of the best bands that never really ""made it"".",

Granted it does best on the wood/tile floors but that is its main purpose. It is lightweight, easy to maneuver and fairly easy to clean out. It is easy to switch to carpet mode. And my hardwood floors have not been scratched at all as some reviewers state. Maybe they are doing their hardwoods on the carpet mode and I could see where the bristles on the brush would scratch but not in bare floor mode. The main downfall is the short cord, I just have to plug it in for each room. I do not have a huge house (1440 sq. feet) so overheating has not been a problem.

"__label__1 Great Editorials not so ""great"": Aside from the editorials included, the writing is dry and often convoluted. The briefs on the historical periods during which these editorials were written could be improved with a little clarity on the author's part.Though this book was compiled in 1997, women are absent from this collection. Thus, this book perpetuates a subtle stereotype that women have worked for years to destroy: that ""greatness"" can only be achieved by or associated with men.Look to this book for a one-sided interpretation of editorial writers and history.",
"__label__2 Work great: A simple little item that saves a lot of caulk. I had been using other caulk tube sealers, most of them that go inside the spout. That style usually causes the spout to split and you loose the seal. Others that go over the spout are made of hard plastic and don't seal well. These are soft, like rubber, and stretch tightly over the spout. They could be used to seal many other things as well.",

Its been 2 months and yesterday I found a dead mouse that I ran over with my car, in the garage. Not in the trap but 20 ft away, nowhere near the trap. I'm a little disappointed because I followed the directions accurately and with 200+ 5 star reviews, I thought it would work.",
"__label__2 Mr. Streissguth includes unusual with expected.: Mr. Streissguth's work is a welcomed effort to begin someone on the path to understanding Dr. Franklin. Though brief, Mr. Streissguth includes many salient points often left out of simple biographies. Points include the difficulties he faced in politics, the failures he knew, the mistakes made. Although written for the young reader, he writes with thoughtfulness and respect. The book never has the ""baby-talk"" voice found in some young reader books.This biography allows the reader to understand Dr. Franklin was a real person living in difficult times. One of the better mini-bio's on Dr. Franklin I have read with 98% accuracy on the details of his life and accomplishments.G.Robin Smith ben@ben-franklin.org",

My only complaint (and this isn't a very big one) is that the station numbers aren't backlit. I'm mostly in the car at night, so it's practically impossible to see what station the transmitter is on without turning on a light.

This book really needed an editor. There were so many errors it just distracted me to no end.The book is written in the form of a diary, and it is an interesting piece of fiction. I like the idea that someone would choose to emigrate to North Korea because of their political ideology. Most of the actual American defectors went to North Korea because they were running away from something, and this book actually postulated what would happen if someone were to run to the ""Communist wonderland"" as the North puts forth in their propaganda. We then watch as the ideal society exposes itself for the true horror it is.All in all, an interesting read, but just go in knowing you might have to re-read several passages several times to understand what the author was trying to say.",

Irritatingly, the fixed portion of the guard goes so far forward and is so far out from the o.d. of the blade that you cannot see the blade begin the cut unless you manouver yourself to the side.

This is an extremely slight book that offers no real insight and says nothing new about any of its subjects -- Transcendental Meditation, the Maharishi, or the Beatles (who appear very little). We learn that practicing TM has benefits but is not a panacea; the Maharishi was not all he was cracked up to be; and celebrities are treated differently than other people (and bigger celebrities more differently still) yet they are human beings too. Stop the presses!The best thing about this book is the photographs, many of which and others can be seen online at www.thebeatlesinindia.com.

This is a cute debut from Megan McCafferty that will certainly appeal to adults who have survived the high school experience and to the teens who are currently living it.

""rocket fuel,"" ""i am too,"" I am two,"" the excellent psychedelic ""guaranteed,"" and ""godsend,"" are all fine pieces of rock and roll. the great, great song here, though, is ""can't complain,"" which is one of my all-time favorite songs by anyone, period. every time i hear that song i have to hit the back button on my cd player and immediately play it again. it's a song so good you have to hear it twice in a row. kudos also should go to will kimbrough, who lays down tasty rock guitar all over this cd. highly, highly recommended.",

This generous anthology serves up all the key tracks - from the Eno-produced ""The Wild, The Beautiful And The Damned"" to ""My Sex"" and ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"", this version of Ultravox was the missing link between Roxy Music and Adam Ant, punk and new wave, glam and art-rock. Its influence on everything that came out of the U.K. in the eighties can't be measured. You certainly don't need all three Island albums; this set is absolutely all you require and you should do so without guilt or remorse. Recommended.",

__label__2 A Great Game: Diablo 2 is a great improvement on the original Diablo. There is a great depth to the game that much improves on the original storyline of Diablo. There are now four fully populated cities with at least six characters in each who you can trade with and get advice from. Each of the cities has their own problem that you have to solve. You solve the problems by completing the quests given to you by the characters. There is an almost unlimited supply of weapons and armor you get. There are unique and magical items that you can only find once in the game. There is a slight improvement in graphics from the original Diablo. There a five video clips in the game- one before each act and one at the end- which are pretty good but take up allot of hard drive space. A full install of the game will take a little over 1.5 gigs of hard drive.,

The music and lyrics are sophomoric and amateurishly produced, all the way around. The musicianship is poor - notes are missed, horns are mostly just blown, not played, and the sound is murky.Nearly all of the songs are bland ""uppers"" - it's a new day, the sun is shining, come on everybody let's sing! I'm all for music that makes you happy, but nice sentiment is not enough - the quality of the musicians, singers and producers has to be there, too.Finally, be warned: the last song is over half an hour(!) of monotonal chanting - a couple of guys basically intoning ""om"" at a few different levels.

His instincts are very good at picking out people who are going to do bad. Jesse does have his internal demons and his emotional intensity for his ex-wife, neither one will let the other move-on.

His voice isn't as raspy as in his previous work, but his vocals are still excellent. The songwriting is very good and the album flows nicely. My only complaint is that Long Time Coming doesn't showcase Jonny's guitar skills. There are only a few solos on the album and his guitar tone isn't as dirty as it was on Smokin', Lie To Me, or Wander This World. Overall, good album by Jonny but I would reccomend getting Lie to Me and Wander this World before this one. Another artist to check out is Howard Lee Edwards. I recently discovered him and I really like his music. He has a new album coming out soon and there are a couple of songs off it on his website www.HowardLeeEdwards.com. Check it out!",

"__label__2 Best one yet.: I read this book in three days and I loved every minute of it. I think some people don't like it, because the tone has changed from excitement of discovering the world of wizards; to dealing with some penent up emtions, which have finally over-flowed. The tone of the book is bitterness of the situation that Harry is put in. It is a typical rebellious teen additude of feeling left out because now more than ever he feels that he can contribute to the ""Cause"" as an equal. Unfortunatly Harry is still treated like a kid which only angers him futher. For those that have watched Star Wars, this is the Empire Stikes Back of the series. To me Dylan Thomas the poet has said it best for the theme of this book and that is ""Do not go gentle into that good night"", ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light.""",

"__label__1 Not worth the price: I agree with the prior reviewer. I mistakenly was under the impression this included the original novel (which I highly enjoyed) along with the kit extras. That was my own mistake of course. However, once realizing that, the kit seemed fairy empty, with charts, coupons, and scrolls that you can only use once. The cards are reusable, but that's the main item with content. Other objects seem to serve more as a distraction than helping you write.I do think the presentation of the kit and design is rather nice. But overall, it feels fairly empty for someone looking for solid, reusable helping content. Subjectively, I felt it more worth a price under $10.",

I should know better than making an impulse buy just from hearing one song on the radio BUT I gave this CD the benefit of the doubt because of it being a ""mixtape"", therefore increasing the odds that it wouldn't be crap. Alright Khaled, Khaleed, whatever your name is, you got me. All you do is scream ""N"" this and ""N"" that as well as saying ""We The Best At This""!! At what? Definitely not making a good album. This is coaster material. Save your money.",

The three main characters (doug, carrie, and arthur) are great, but what people forget to mention are the side characters. Spence is by far my favorite! We all know someone like him! The sceens with Doug and Deacon are really funny too! Doug always seems to drag deacon into something he knows he shouldn't get into... and of course all kinds of zany things get under way.Great show if you just want to laugh and forget about the real world for a bit.",
"__label__2 Good, but also repetitive: The McCade books are very good, among my all-time faves, but they're getting a bit repetitive. At least this time around there aren't any assasins, but in Alien Bounty McCade manages to wind up in chains not once but TWICE, and once again manages to get rescued by his buds, Rico, eversoheavily armed, and Phil, once a slave himself. In the next novel, McCade's Bounty, our galactic space hero's daughter is enslaved by the space pirates. I swear, I would be suprised if in McCade's world anyone lower in status than Lakorian royalty was NOT a slave at some point, considering the stats. Also, the part in Alien Bounty about Mustapha Pong is a bit short. Other than those two points, though, MCCADE ON THE RUN excels. It weaves an intricate, complex universe in its diverse worlds, some of which entirely artificial. Dont expect any of that ""Oh, it's a lava world"" nonsense.This book deserves 4.5 stars, but hey, I'm a pessimist.",

Not sure what Barbie those clothes are supposed to fit. They did not fit any of my daughters barbies, only one shirt or skirt (can't remember which) was usable, the rest were way too small and useless. We even tried them on Bratz dolls too, but they did not fit the Bratz dolls properly. This was a toy that ended up in the garbage the first time I went through her toys after Christmas.

I was never to have to page through two huge book trying to find artwork, I would only need to type in key words and the options would be on my screen. Well guess what, it didn't work. What is even worse, the new book that replaces the old two books, has tiny thumbnails of all the art, it's really disgusting to look for something. To top it off, I got my set of DVDs and I got two #3's and no #4. It was a hassle to get them to say they'd send me out the #4 DVD. I should have received it by now.

Well, I won't be buying another one of Mr. White's books after reading this one.The story line included a bunch of sub stories that really didn't have anything to do with the main storyline. (Spoilers ahead!!) A son who had ordered his own paternity test. An ex lesbian lover pregnant with Doc's child who turns out not to be an ex lesbian. A neurotic best friend that has a promonition that Doc is dying while in the middle of surgery and puts himself in a drug crazed coma to reach out to him. And on and on and on. The book starts out with a bang and then loses it entirely and never picks up speed again. I would say 50% of the book's writing does not belong in the book and doesn't add to the storyline. I only finished it because I hate not finishing a book, but this was ridiculous.I won't bother recommending this book to anyone. Sorry.",

"__label__1 Heigl + Kutcher = 0: IF you've ever wondered what ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (or, the TV shows ""Scarecrow & Mrs. King"" and/or ""Hart To Hart"") would be like drained of all wit & charm, ""Killers"" is the result. Mr. A. Kutcher is STILL pretty much playing Kelso (""That 70s Show"") and never for a second did I believe him as a pro killer. Ms. Kat H shows just how limited her acting range is. The action scenes are nothing special and the dialogue is fairly lame. I KNOW it's a 'popcorn movie' and not meant to be taken (too) seriously, but JEEEZ, I think I actually laughed maybe ONCE. If you've NEVER seen ""Get Smart"" (the TV show, not the movie), ""Hart To Hart,"" or Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"" or ANY 'James Bond' movies, you MIGHT like ""Killers.""

You could have an emotional affair with your mother or your best friend.Instead of focusing on real issues that cause ""jealousy"" Neuman blatantly says that we should avoid and be on guard for those people who might even want a friendship.This whole concept is wrong.There are better books and better sources to read",

The judge in the case had the ability to lessen the death sentence but instead declared Peterson guilty of such an egregious crime that he should die for it...... and the judge sat through the proceedings and listened to ALL of the evidence.

It makes a good looking, good tasting loaf that's plenty for two meals for me so it would be a great plenty for a meal, or more, for two people. I think this machine is a winner !!",

If you've attempted to burn the cd using realplayer, you may be able to play the cd in the car just know that you won't be able to skip tracks, some of the tracks will stutter and skip like a scratched record and some tracks just won't play at all.

Only complaint is that the plastic material was smelly & hot if you were not out in the cool air. I aired the costume out and it was great!,

This happened one two many times on this CD. I actually considered returning it before I opened it because Dope Gonzales has a hip-hop flavor rather than an actual house flavor and I thought it was sent in error. I held it for 2 wks until I consulted a NY DJ about it. Whatever he and LLV do as MAW is magic, but there is something less desired here. But I will say that he did start jamming towards the last five jams of the first CD. But at a club, I would be demanding my $$$ back. Anyone wanna buy a copy of this? I have one for sale",

All the slow ""love songs"" are written by the man himself, there are also some uptempos ongs he had some help on. One thing youll hear on this CD is the meaningful words, but the chords, vocals, instruments, EVRYTHING. It will capture your mind, when u hear Brians Vocals on ""6,8,12"" u know that it cant get any better, then you hear the breakdown on ""Shall We Begin"" smooth....as silk. But dont leave out the 5 uptempo songs where it can get no better, in my opion way better than ""You should be Mine"". Overall this album is much better than his ""Anytime"" album which had a bit more hip-hop/pop sound to it. The only reson it does get only 4 stars is becuse i dont know what Mr. McKnight will deliver next...can it get better? Im just not sure - Ray Roa",

No team create, player creation lacks fun. And trying to increase players skills is hard and a bad way of improving your player. If you play with you team past 2006 to 2020 etc. the rookies will start being numbered ""0"" or single digit numbers for any type of position, an exmaple being Linbacker number ""5.""

My two favorite songs are ""Day of Freedom"" and ""Always be my Home"" I am Catholic and this would be a excellent to listen in front of our Lord himself.

Who needs 11 recipes for apple butter, for instance? It appears to be a thick book, but in reality, it could be a third thinner with no discernable loss in content or quality. It is tedious, to say the least. On the plus side, the spiral binding makes it quite user-friendly, allowing it to lie flat, and remain open.",

Most interesting parts were about her distrust of Kennedy because of his father & his Catholicism Although Eleanor was very liberal she had a distrust of the hidden designs of the Catholic Church based on life long encounters with it. Cardinal Spellman maintained a personal vendetta against her for being against giving public aid to Catholic schools & the long standing arch conservatism of the Catholic Church in civil rights & personal freedom. The Years Alone only touches on her achievements in welfare, refugee rights & disillusion with the Eisenhower administration & how her many talents were passed over by the Republicans.",

"__label__2 A Fresh Sound to a Point. . .: With some of the same tone and feeling as Nik B√§rtsch's Ronin modal improvisations, this album of the postmodern avant-garde trio The Bad Plus demonstrates why they were selected for the recent album of Disney covers, Everybody Wants to Be a Cat. Their deconstruction of familiar tunes and their own compositions (three by bassist Anderson, two by drummer King, and one by pianist Iverson) are energetic and often noisy. Each musician is a percussionist, each a melody maker. The scratchy, nervous music may be jarring to many, but others may appreciate the cleverness, humor, and audacity. The lyricism between the discord, as with track 5, Giant, arises as a fresh breeze. The well-matched team of musicians create a fresh, bright and challenging sound. The problem is that repeated listening tarnishes that brilliance. The musical approach soon seems to be only a gimmick.",
__label__1 Fiction: Fiction folks. This is another fiction by the same writer. Kids who have no knowledge of the reality of the Pagan beliefs eat this stuff up. As all the other books like this I doubt there is a claim by the writer or publishers that it was meant to be taken literally or even seriously. Kids do though so it keeps them busy with make-believe until they grow up and remember these reads so they can become interested in the real thing. Just hopefully it won't lead to them becoming interested in the negative things that are often associated with occult matters. Sometimes kids can't seperate the differences. That is my only objection to these writings. But for the most part kids are pretty smart today and most know these types of books are nothing more than entertainment. I only am concerned about the ones who are looking to fit into something and maybe go too far.,
"__label__2 Lots of action: Great book if you like action stories. Complex, well-developed characters. Intriguing plot. Four sets of villains, sometimes hard to keep track of who's who, especially everybody is not what the seem. Long discourses on Bible history sometimes interrupts action at inappropriate times. Cotton Malone is a wonderfully developed character and I will read additional Steven Berry books with this character.",

Can I just say, that I really tried to like this game! I have been playing Final Fantasy since I was a kid when the very first Final Fantasy came out on the original Nintendo. While, the characters and story and graphics are amazing... the battle system just kills the game for me. I know that Final Fantasy was probably trying to appeal to a new demographic, and perhaps the series has left me behind. I have tried over and over again to like this game, I just can't get past the ""over and over"" battle tubes... I feel like this game is just one repeat after another. I just wasn't able to keep interest in the game. For the first time, Final Fantasy has disappointed me, and for the very first time, I won't complete a Final Fantasy game.

The ability to create new and powerful items and weapons, and use parts from the ones you find, or to buy parts.Play Magazine (Hey, I like to site my sources) has done a wonderful job covering it past issues, giving it a B+ on review (pretty high for them), and the reviews from other game magazines (Gamers, IGN, OPM) sound favorable too. Yeah, its going to be like the first one... its a sequel, set in the same place. HOWEVER, If you liked the first, and you know the first, dont worry... the second sounds like it is as good, if not better. (4 stars because the first one was good, and this one isnt released yet.)",

Vocals are about the only thing I like here, Atilla sounds very ""necro"", which is why I'm giving it two stars. I would only recommend this album to a die hard Mayhem fan like me.

I can't help but smile watching her magnetism on screen. Has an actress ever fit a iconic role more than Ms. Carter? I don't think so. This alone is worth the price of the DVD boxed set...but seeing the fun episodes and how entertaining they really are, makes it a keeper.

"__label__1 Lust for Life, Indeed!: Douglas as Van Gogh was a reincarnation of the artist himself. Van Gogh was an eccentric and tormented soul. Douglas manifested all the elements needed to descibe and fullfill the artist's message. Like all the great artists, Modiliani, Gauguin and Van Gogh were haunted by the demons of their past, which inevitably lead to their self destruction. An excellent film to all, not just art historians.",

"__label__2 The best book I've seen on the subject.: This book clearly explains the operation of caches and MP systems in a way I've never seen before. The books used in my computer architecture class always left me with a somewhat vague feeling on how things worked, plus they only barely mentioned the software issues. Similarly, my OS class never really got into MP subjects like memory ordering and the effect of caches on the OS. But this book brought everything into focus with clear explanations and good examples.The best way to describe this book is that it's part computer architecture book and part operating systems book. The operation of the hardware is presented in good detail, without going as far as worrying about gates and transistors. The software issues are also described in detail along with various solutions and trade-offs between them.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand the operation of caches and SMP systems from both the hardware and software point of view.",

I don't really listen to what passes for country radio, and I was lucky (blessed even?) to find out about The Star Room Boys back in the glory days of Napster.

We took it back to Babies R Us where it was purchased and even the manager couldn't figure out how to fix it. That part of the seat already comes put together, so it's not something we screwed up. We exchanged it for the same chair so we'll see if that one works out better. If not we're going to a different model. Other than that, we like the chair and it's features.

"__label__2 Probably the most exiting album of the year!: This album makes me happy everytime I hear it( almost everyday), it is so much better than Live Through This, because it has more passion in its songs, and it's full of happiness. Courtney was really inspirated when she wrote the album lyrics, they're so cool and the songs are delicious to listen to. I love it and recomend it to everyone who still have a doubt on buying this, it's gratious and has also the hard guitars that are on the Live Through This as well. I mostly enjoy the songs ""Awful"", ""Calebrity Skin"" and ""Heaven Tonight"". A must hear!!",

However, if you want something quick to read that doesn't take much concentration you may opt for this romantic thriller.",

Lo and behold, the replacement item was the exact same low quality item. I ended up paying $50 LESS to get an actual hardcover from a third party seller on the site.

Try as I might, I could not force my way into this book. I tried skipping some chapters and jumping into the middle, but that didn't work any better. The story was heavy, overdone, and sluggish.

"__label__1 Abandon Senses!: I'm sorry, but the great serious issues at the heart of this film are simply swamped by odd and often hilarious acting, reactions, edits and transitions. Like the boat, the participants are wooden and sterotyped. The black man is ""put in his place"" by Tyrone Powers, who shouts him into subserviance; later, he sings a spiritual - no kidding. There's the Italian hood with a switchblade, the officious army commander, the loose woman, the professor, and Mary Ann! No kidding, they are all there, 26 of 'em. Even Tyrone gets the treatment as our conflicted hero. The loose woman gives us the defining aside on Tyrone: ""THERE'S a MAN!""I rated this not zero, or one star - but I gave it two, simply because this is an absolute stitch to watch. It means well, it is so earnest. For that alone it surely deserves notice as a serious hoot.Now, back to bailing...",

I would definitely NOT recommend these for outdoor running/walking/biking because they allow so little outside noise in. However, for the gym, the office, the library, etc, they are great. The sound quality is not concert quality but extremely good for mid-range headphones. Great buy for the price, just be warned that you will hear nothing from the outside world!",

Chris Farley who was a very funny man never reached his potential in films, even those who are not a fan of his ""in your face"" humor would have to admit to finding at least one thing he did hysterical. 'Tommy Boy' is by far his crowning achievement on film and probably the only film starring Farley worth owning. This film shows Chris bloated and worn out from years of excess and is kind of hard to watch. It's a sad way to cap off a career that gave so many people joy. This is purely for the Farley diehard fans only. I just couldn't bring myself to give this 1 star!",

""Sister Fate"", her obvious ode to Prince, was the first release from this sophomore effort, and a very mundane number that lacked the ummf that the single ""Glamourous Life"" exuded . Next was ""Love Bizarre"" (her 12 minute plus duet with Prince)which actually saved the album from complete ennui and possibly diminished record sales. ""Dear Michealangelo"", ""Yellow"" and the title track itself are listenable, but really don't measure up to the fire of the songs on ""The Glamourous Life"".",
"__label__1 A Big Disappointment: My son and I had great expectations for this game; our expectations quickly turned in to disappointment. This ""game"" is really hard to call a game. It's more like one long reading exercise. Unlike many of the other L-Max games, wherein you learn the modules through interactive play, with this one you have to read and read and read the same story over again. Once you complete the story, you can then go to another area to ""unlock"" the game. Then in order to play the ""game"" you have to read some more. This is not the type of game where you can standby and provide guidance when needed, I found myself reading page, after page, after page, just to figure out for myself the objective of the ""game"" and then try to explain it to my son. I felt the money I paid for this game was a waste, no wonder when I went to purchase it, it was the only one in stock. Buyers beware!",
"__label__2 Spectacular Coverage of a Spectacular Music Label: One of the best things about LPs, as opposed to CDs, was the ability to flip the sleeves in stores during browsing. I started listening to jazz in the early 1980's, and was rapidly transfixed by the beauty and originality of the artwork on releases from the ECM jazz label, out of Germany. Since 1970, ECM has released nearly 700 albums of wonderful music, much of which defies categorization. What remains is their clearly identifiable (but often imitated - such as by Windham Hill) cover graphic style, making their releases art collector items as well as music. This book describes the history of the ECM sleeve art, as well as provides color pictures of essentially all of their releases up to the publication date of the book.

You are given the highlight speeches, but never the circumstances in which they are given. Joan did not live in a vaccuum.

"__label__1 Would be nice to hear the orchestra...: But instead of the orchestra, we are treated to the wonderful sound of reverb, along with some very fine compression artifacts when the cannons go off. I was truly disappointed by the sound of this - it is the aural equivalent of mud and cotton, very mushy, hard to make out the details, and not something I really want to deal with. The conducting seems particularly heavy handed, as if the conductor wanted to make a name for himself by making his own slight alterations to the piece that, while not significant, are unnecessary and very irritating. Poor recording technique and a wierd performance, but wait! There's a warning on the label that the cannons are very loud!! Oh my, then this MUST be the recording to get to show off a [amt.] stereo in the bachelor pad - maybe the cannons will be so loud that your date will hop right into your lap!This is to classical music what a primer-grey muscle car is to a show of luxury automobiles.",

To say that this book transformed the way I look at poetry and art as a whole is an understatement. It should be a core component of any discussion of 20th century aesthetics. It's a masterpiece.",

I cannot recall much of the content on this album because it was quickly sold to some schmuck on the internet. All I have to say is that it's halarious that he would sing Unchained Melody after Clay. The problem with all of these sappy teen pop stars is that all theyc an do is ballads. If you have a good voice, as I give that Justin does, ballads are a piece of cake, but to write and sing a song that really get's people moving, that is so much more of a challenge. That is why Justin Timberlake is a sucess and Justin Guarini will be a blip on ""Remember the 00's"" on VH1 in 30 years.",
"__label__2 Their Best Yet: I know people always say that a new album is the band's ""best yet"", just because it is new. However, I say this after much thought. The band MxPx has left behind some of the pure punk heard on ""Pokinatcha"" or ""Teenage Politics"" and went more the way of the buffalo. Instead of the fuzzy guitar riffs, and hyperactive drums, we have polished pop-punk and hyperactive drums. A great tradeoff.Most of the songs on this album have the catchiness of ""I'm Okay, You're Okay"" or ""The Downfall of Western Civilization"". The best cuts on this album are ""Responsibility"" and ""The Next Best Thing"".If you are a fan of MxPx, or even of Blink 182, Gob, Less than Jake, or other similar bands, pick up this album: you won't regret it.PxPx!",

I'm the typical purchaser of the book--HTML-literate looking to learn Javascript. It came highly recommended, so I immediately purchased it. In retrospect, I should have bought Javascript Sourcebook instead--I learned HTML with that superb ""Sourcebook"" series, and i should have stuck with it. The Javascript Bible starts off promising for the beginner, and introduces JS well. But it then jumps into hundreds of objects and functions and doesnt explain their context and placement. I was lost. Another reviewer here said you'll get lost after Chap4--boy, is he ever right! After Chap4, the inexperienced JS programmer will be absolutely befuddled and clueless. To its credit, the book offers lots of code examples; but it doesn't explain how and why the code was written. I'm very disappointed. In short, if you've never programmed in JS before, this book won't teach you. No way.",

I used the provided power supplies and wireless adapter that it came with along with every combination of dip-switch settings on the camera and possible position of the knob on the receiver with nothing better than a very irritating noise from the audio and an extremely choppy and unable to be made out image from the video - this was at only 24 feet away with no obstructions. Then I tried even closer (see the posted video) at less than 7 feet with no obstructions and still had a terrible picture and sound. I am an avid technology geek and DIYer and I can usually get anything to work, so if I can't make it do what I want, it will surely disappoint you. I'd advise to all others to find an alternative as I will be doing the same.",
"__label__2 Sony KV-32HS420: For the purpose I got this it does a great job. We use it to watch DVD's, we have it hooked through the S-video connection and it looks great. Eventually we plan to upgrade to the HDMI connection and I'm sure it'll look much better. There's enough inputs in this TV to fill anyones needs.We tried hooking up our kids video games to it but it actually looked worst than our 10 year old Quasar, it sort of looked too pixelated?! So we kept our games connected to the ""old box."" Maybe I just need to read the manual and change some settings?Sony makes great products, but I really hate their customer service with a passion. I purposely stayed away from buying their products for over 13 years. If I could find anything comparable I would always go with the competition. With this TV I couldn't so I broke down and finally bought another Sony.Another thing, it's really heavy, I believe it weighs over 150 lbs. I was able to move it but I'm not a small guy.....",

This dvd has the same exact special features as that one. So why do we need this ""special edition""? So that Universal studios can make more money because they believe that no one will buy it unless it's a new release. To me there is no point in doing a re-release if nothing but the sound changes from the previous edition.",

What at great night in a saloon! There is chemistry which is hard to find in many groups these days. There is creativity which crosses many lines of music including Jazz, Bluegrass, Rock, etc. The musicianship is 5 star and one only has to listen to Bright Place and Last Date to discover the sensual, sexual, creative side of these guys. I hope they stay together and continue to produce this kind of stuff forever. If you don't like what you hear, move south and thaw out.",

"__label__1 I wish I could give it zero stars.: I received this as a birthday present. I first tried making a loaf of honey wheat bread and followed the instructions from the manual. I was happy with how easy it was....I was unhappy with the results. Basically after the cycle was over, I was presented with a soggy brick of half dough/half undercooked bread. It was inedible and I basically wasted a bunch of ingredients. I thought maybe it was just a first time around mistake on my part and decided I'd give it another shot. I made the easiest possible recipe and once again I wasted 4 cups of flour plus all of the other ingredients on a soggy half baked lump of dough that had to go in the trash. I've never had a brand new machine just not work at all. It was really disappointing. If you're thinking of buying this bread maker I urge you not to.",

You know-- skinny suede sole with nubbies on the bottom. Plus, the weaving is very delicate (which is beautiful). I have been very careful not to wear them anywhere where they would get wet. I even passed my turn in line for a bathroom stall because the floor looked damp. In other words, more cautious than one should have to be with shoes. With all that care, after four wearings, the bottom of one shoe is beginning to wear through the little woven straps of ultra soft leather. If these shoes had the sole of a shoe rather than a slipper, they would be my favorite pair of shoes. Now that they're falling apart, I can't wear them (looks tacky). Outside of a long car, plane, or train trip, I doubt they'll see daylight again. Sniff, sniff, tear.",

"__label__2 Forgotten Eastwood film that also stars George Kennedy: Simple plot but a nice change of pace considering his path of Westerns and soon to be string of Dirty Harry cop films, Eastwood is every bit his own man in this mountain climbing adventure. The film is based on a novel by Trevanian, and surrounds the story of a man sent with 3 other climbers. He is blackmailed to execute one of them while climbing with them in the Swiss Alps. Stormy weather, icy conditions and that brutal devil called gravity also prove not to be Jonathan Hemlock's friend. Eastwood plays the part of Hemlock and does so quite convincingly, but not only that this is a gem in which it was also directed by Eastwood himself! The drama that unfolds on the climb in the alps is nothing short of spectacular, and this is definitely a must see for Eastwood fans of a younger generation of his films that might have missed it the first time.",

"__label__1 Disappointed: I recently lost my beloved pet of 15 years and was looking for words of hope and comfort that one day I will get to see him again. I did not get that from this book. It was brief and I felt like I was reading a children's book. I received more comfort and hope from the paragraph I received about the Rainbow Bridge from the SPCA. I was very disappointed that the book was so short with very little detail. Normally Sylvia describes the afterlife and the ornate buildings and duties and way of life in great detail, so my expectations were high. I read this book cover to cover in about 5 minutes and came away angry that I wasted my money. I realize that afterlife may be a fantasy but in times of mourning, you are searching for anything that brings comfort and this book fell extremely short in that area.",
"__label__1 Another Poor Attempt to Capture the Spirit of Columbo: For those of you who have watched the Columbo show for many years, you will be sorely disappointed by this book, as well as the entire Columbo series. The brilliance of the old show was the subtlety in which Columbo got things done. Here, all the subtlety is pushed to the front as the reader can barely go 5 pages without a reference to Mrs. Columbo. There is no panache in which the murder is solved. No, hard-hitting Columbo. Just boring, diffuse, loose ends, that when they come together, you wish you would have sat down and watched on of the episodes that you've already seen 20 times.",

That notwithstanding this album is as near perfection as one could imagine or hope for. I bought a vinyl copy some 30 years ago and it still enthralls and moves me. The production, lyrical content and execution is a shining beacon in the wastelands of modern day R+B. Like all Perfect Angels you are a comet amongst the stars Minnie, still dazzling us with your brightness years after you passed by and long after other stars have faded",
"__label__1 Could be Great!?: The Toshiba SD3950 has all the add-ons a basic DVD player owner could want. A very nice remote control, Auto-play for both DVD's and audio cd's (also autoplays Mp3's), very easy set-up...just plug in and let'er rip. That is where the niceties end.The Toshiba SD3950 has terrible audio, primarily on Mp3 and CD playback. The sound is distorted, it's as though the outputs are overdriven. Audio on DVD's is not all that great either. You can set up the audio to hear dialogue using the audio settings, but you sacrifice overall audio quality, this because the player raises mid-range and nearly ignores other frequencies. Thus overall audio quality is sacrificed so you can hear dialogue you may not be able to hear otherwise.Bottom line: NICE features, NICE Remote, VERY,VERY POOR audio!!!",

"__label__2 Thank you, David.: In June, I attended a David Sedaris reading, part of his latest book tour. At the end, he held up Francine Prose's ""Blue Angel"" and said it was the funniest book he's read in a long time. So, knowing his work, I went into this novel expecting laugh out loud hilariousness. This novel is so much more though. Prose writes with such a clever hand that you don't often laugh out loud, but chuckle inside at her deft use of language and humor and wordplay. I loved the characters, especially Swenson, his wife Sherrie, and of course, the Angela, the Blue Angel herself. If you've ever taken a college creative writing class, you'll appreciate the numerous scenes where student stories are workshopped. Francine Prose captures college life and student attitudes perfectly. This novel made me want to read other Prose books.",

I was wrong, if you expect this album to be anything like the modern Bluegrass of the first album don't bother coming here. I liked many of the songs on the first CD but it seems like all of the selections here are much more Pop flavored, little or no tradition to them (the video I saw on TV was too weird to believe). Any of the group members can do much better than the work they display here, Sean Watkins is a good instrumentalist and Sara Watkins can really sing, but they left that behind on this one.

As soon as we finished Mr.Mole appeared and started tearing it all up. Reviews here were awesome so I gave the product a try. Used all 6 whole worms. Didn't touch the worn with my fingers or with anything with my scent on it. Found frequently traveled holes to put them in. Waited a week. No results. Mole still lives. Feel like I'm on ""CaddyShack"". The worst thing? Mr.Mole continued to use the tunnels I put the worm in, even pushed the worms out of the tunnel in a dirt pile. 3 of the 6 worm locations resulted in big dirt patches. Moles hunt by finding the vibrations their food gives off when moving... Not sure why I thought an immobile product would work. Time to call the exterminator. Save your money.

After setting it up I realized that the frequency the fan's remote works on is the same that the frequency of the remote control for my TV. Whenever I press the volume button on my TV remote - it turns the fan on and changes the speeds on the fan. Needless to say this has been very annoying and I have to make sure either the fan isn't plugged in when I don't want to use it OR that I don't use the remote anywhere near the Fan anymore when I am using the TV remote. This is annoying to say the least. I assume they changed the frequency of the remote on the fan since I purchased it the last time a couple of years ago. Otherwise the fan itself is nice.,

I had such a strong reaction to this one he encouraged me to review it.As others have reported, this is the sequel to Isabella. I found the story a bit hard to follow and a bit hard to believe, but it does have some interesting twists on the usual period romance formula, That is not really the problem.The Kindle edition I base this review on has so many typos it is very nearly impossible to read. I can only guess it was scanned using some OCR process and never looked at again. Sentences stop in the middle of a thought. Made-up words appear, which if you think about the shape of the letters, suggest a potential replacement which would actually fit (""Parrington"" should be ""Farrington"" and ""Thome"" should be ""Thorne"", for instance.)

The author did nothing to develop the characters and portrayed them as shallow, petty, stupid, jealous people who were, for the most part, unlikeable.The story line was imbued with inaccuracies where both computer technology and the travel industry were concerned, and these inaccuracies highlight the authors obvious lack of research. I almost begged for Diane and Jeff to simply ""get on with it"" as the supposed romantic portion of this lame storyline dragged on and on.

Some of his suggestions about why we shouldn't confront people are contrary to Jesus' express commands that we are required to confront people in their sins (Matt:18:15-17). I found Jay Adams book Handbook of Church Discipline helpful in explaining Matthew 18:15-17, along with John MacArthur's book on Forgiveness, and Ken Sande's book The Peacemaker.",

But a fearless and brilliant one. Great work.",
__label__1 why so pricy?: I prefer to read on my Kindle but I can't see the justification for a higher price for the digital edition for this 6 year old book than for hardback or softcover. It's ridiculous and I won't support the publisher in ripping off Kindle users this way.,

"__label__2 GREAT BOOK, BUT NOT ONE OF KING'S BEST: I am a BIG Stephen King fan! I have read such books as The Dark Half, Carrie, Cugo, Christine, and The Shining. The Dark Half started out a little slow then picked up lots of speed that built up to the climax. I thought the ending could have been better and just a little bit more realistic. This book is pretty intense, and has a lot of gore!! But over all this book is very good!!",

"__label__2 Twelve Southerners warn of their regions cultural loss: I thoroughly enjoyed this collection of essays by Twelve Southerners who write of the South's agrarian tradition and its temptation to abandon it for the rootless money-grubbing way of the industrial north. Their prophecy that the South would join the mindless, generic and robotic industrial culture of the north unless she defended her roots in the soil has nearly come true. This book serves as a great treatise on what the South was really fighting to preserve in the War Between the States; her agrarian culture. It is a must for those wanting a look at the true Southern Culture-not that of Hollywood or her enemies in the north.",

The integration of industrial and metal music brought us to the mainstream Ministry, then White Zombie and then Static-X. Following the tradition of high quality industrial-metal, Hanzel √ºnd Gretyl can now claim the place of the best industrial-metal band. With the military-style Third Reich from the sun, the ultra-catchy ich bin √ºber alles, the groovy komm zu ens to the decadant fury of SS Deathstar supergalactic (listen it right now. I'm serious), this album is sure to please everyone who can accept that putting electronic into metal is a good thing. This is the evolution of metal, and bands shouldn't fear using technology to do their music. Hanzel √ºnd Gretyl does it incredibly.",
"__label__1 Show, slow, slow...: I've read and enjoyed this author's previous series set in Alaska, so I was really looking forward to a new sleuth and a new setting. However, this novel reads more like a travelogue with a bit of mystery thrown in as an afterthought. There are endless (and I do mean endless) descriptions of the scenery, the flora, the fauna .. and minute-by-minute descriptions of Maxie's daily activities. The suspense, when it occurs, is good, but there just isn't enough of it.",

Must use iTunes - This is sad because there are better applications out there3. Shuffle Play is limited - It is difficult to set a shuffle play for anything smaller than the entire ipod or a playlist.

"__label__1 too vulnerable: I first purchased a kindle in May 2011 for a year of teaching abroad. Having steady access to electronic books was a lifesaver, and I never went anywhere without it. However it has a fatal flaw: a complete lack of durability. in one year in Thailand and traveling, I broke three kindles; each time, Amazon sent a replacement, and a family member who happened to be visiting brought it along. I finally just broke my fourth kindle, and am out of warranty.I may be especially hard on my kindle- travel tends to be difficult- but travel is precisely when I need it. My macbook has lasted 6 years, my iphone has lasted roughly 4 times my average kindle's lifespan,and now, I am going to have to purchase something more durable. this product was a huge disappointment because its promise was so great, because it's so laughably fragile.",

There has never been a steel building destroyed by fire, including ones where explosions occured.

After application, the dog shook, spraying little drops of it all over our living room. Any plastic the product hit (including the glossy black frame and base of our plasma TV) immediately developed PITS in the plastic, even though I grabbed a cloth to wipe it clean as soon as it happened.

"__label__1 Disappointed: After having read a fair number of John Irving's earlier novels, I was disappointed with the cardboard characters in this one and the endless elaboration on pointless details. Not once did I get to feel any identification with the main characters. I literally struggled through the 500+ pages of the hardback version.Apart from Toronto, Maine and LA, the book describes scenes in Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Edinburgh and Zurich and Mr Irving has gone through great pains to insert local insiders info, rendering the book into something of a tourist guide. The author indulges here in a writer's trick to add interestingness to the novel, which I found irritating.The subject matter is fashionable, and only that, and as thin as the paper is was printed on.I would not recommend this novel.",
"__label__1 Robbins should disassociate himself from this trash: I was extremely disappointed in this book. I like Tony Robbins' books and tapes and thought this would be a chance to learn more about him. Well, I learned nothing new and wasted my money. Although I expected the book to be positive about Tony Robbins, I was surprised that it was written in such a sycophantic manner. It was also very poorly written and had all the elements of a rush job. Mr Bolduc would benefit from a basic writing course and some research skills. It looked to me that he was wondering how he could profit from his association with Tony Robbins and figured that writing a book was the only way possible. The problem is that he's not any good at it. Do yourself a favour and spend the money on something by Robbins himself.",
"__label__1 Not for non-dog-owners: A dog's life is not particularly interesting, and that goes for Marley in Marley & Me. With this in mind, of course, this book is more about Mr. Grogan's family experiences before, during and after the ownership of Marley. Unfortunately for the reader, but probably fortunately for Mr. Grogan, the author's family life is not particularly exciting, either. This book is unlikely to appeal to the non-dog-owner, and quick perusal of the positive reviews here support my claim. Although I do like dogs, Marley and his family do not seem very different from any other dog-owning family out there. Unless you have a Fido in the family, I recommend you pass on this one.",

There are no such stories on this disc. They are the 1920s and 30s, black and white, silent cartoons (music and sound effects dubbed in). The heading for some of them is Aesop's Fables (songs) and the title of the cartoon is Circus Calamities (or some such). Others are headed Looney Toons and star Bosko and the other early characters.

The tedious narrative in the first person by the same characters one after the other and so on and so forth, while a novelty at fist soon becomes a tiresome reading exercise.

He then guide the golfers on how to control distance from 100 yards with all wedges, to picth and chip the ball from around the green,and to play bunker shot. He does not only shows how to play all these shots but also include how the ball will react on the greens in details. This part make this book different from other short game books.

But it is simply so sweet & perfect for a romantic at heart like me. It helps a lot too that all the main characters are so beautiful to look and can act well.

Unfortunately,while Lott seems to be have an adequate grasp of the language, hisstorytelling skills just do not rise to the same level.A whodunit of sorts is marred by an overly tedious narrative and far-too-convenient plot twists that ultimately lead to a flat climax. Furthermore, the story is tied up just a tad too neatly--when the person........... You've no doubt seen any number of cheesy James Bond villains do the exact same thing (""Since I am going to kill you very soon, Mr. Bond, it doesn't matter if I let you in on my little secret, does it?"").

Also,we find the ability to store 100 different numbers in each handset a plus; especially when they are used by two different people.The answering machine also has excellent sound and is easy to use.

Each episode is different. Each movie will be different and have a different feel to it...a different flavor. We can't be too critical about how it was compared to the previous film. The next one will be different still. Enjoy the movie for what it is. A journey into a world that most of us can't go. The cinematography was very Woo. It was fast paced and blended well with the soundtrack that accompanied it. The acting was well done and the story may not have been completely original...but it is still fun to see all the action that takes place from beginning to end. Buy this movie to have a good time and enjoy what these people have worked so hard to create for the audience. A good cutting-edge cinimatic adventure film with loud music and exciting new stunts never before seen on film. Enjoy.,

This book provides numerous tips on how to write a screenplay somebody may actually want to buy. It shows numerous references to actual movies, explaining key points in great detail. Be that as it may, it didn't cover absolutely everything I've read about screenplay development, so I definitely wouldn't call it a ""complete book of screenwriting.""

"__label__1 Been there..: For much of this book, Cahill seems to have merely paraphrased most of the Hebrew scriptures. If a reader already has a working knowledge of this text, they may find this book boring and not very informative. Since I came to this book with a good understanding of the Hebrew Bible, I was very disappointed. Perhaps a reader who is not familiar with the Hebrew text would find the large middle section informative and interesting. As for me, it was merely annoying, because I keep waiting for new information or a new insight.However, his commentary of the development of the beginning of Western thought was interesting. It was an angle that I did not consider before. We are so used to Western Civilization being around, that we forget that the thought had to develop at some point. To trace that development was interesting... but I just wish that that tracing did not have to include the paraphrase of much of the Hebrew Bible.",

I have read many books like this in the past, but this one is by far one of the best.",
"__label__2 One of the Best Universal Remotes: Set-up was a breeze. It does take some time to key in all your components, but once you're done, it's easy as can be. Doesn't take a tech genius to do this. Would have gone for the 890, but cost is so much more for IR feature and backlight. Remote is comfortable, and rechargeable batteries are a definite plus. Logitech has every one of my devices, even for my A/V switch which caused me some concerns, but Logitech had it. Much better than I hoped. Wife loved the simplicity of the remote. One-button push much easier to turn on devices. I currently have 9 programs for this remote. Absolutely love this remote. Can't live without it now.",

"__label__2 Thinking man's hip hop: This is a landmark album in the history of hip hop. Though it did not have the mainstream appeal of todays corporate rap machine, it enjoyed huge popularity. And was very important in terms of guiding hip hop into its concious activist, and spiritual movement. However, the album is by no means preachy. Brother J is one of the most gifted lyricist of all time. He paints beautiful images with his metaphors and analogies which allow the listener to be immersed in a world of intellect and spirituality outside the eurocentric philosophies.Beyond that- the beats are just banging. X clan ignited the use of old school(70's/80's)samples. But they go a step further and incorporate tribal rhythms which connect the modern urbanite to a time past when the wisdom of the ages was not lost. This album is a must for anyone that wants to hear truly inspired and purposeful hip hop.",

Big disappointment!!I stumbled upon this wisdom within the body a few years back and have used it in my chiropractic practice since. It truly is an amazing biofeedback mechanism. Up until I read Power vs. Force I thought I was crazy. Power vs. Force was refreshing to me because it confirmed the existence of this communication pathway.However, the most important thing that I have learned while using this method daily for years is that you will get what you are looking for. If you are not careful in your questioning - you will get the answers that you want or expect. Single blind studies don't cut it. Try double blind tests - Bush doesn't come out looking as good as Hawkins would like us to believe & 2nd hand smoke is detrimental to our health.Dr. Hawkins, in my opinion, has fallen into this trap with this latest book.",

He claims that the sheriff and media are covering the truth, his ""truth"" being that there is a war against Christianity (sheriff and media are fighting Jesus). That is just the beginning of the bunk this guy tries to force feed young America. This is propagand on the largest scale. The good side is that most will realize that this is put out by some who are desperately trying to hang on to their time in the spotlight (and make a little money while they are at it), even if they have to use tragic teen deaths to do so.",

"__label__1 A promising begining, but a pathetic ending: A Man in Full starts off with tremendous promise. Wolfe again weaves the same rich tapestry of characters, who intersect in and out of one another's lives, much as he did in Bonfire. I was really looking forward to a delicious climax. But less than half way through the book, we get lost. Instead, the players who seemed to offer the possibility of such rich texture muddle about as charicatures of themselves, or of players we've seen before in Bonfire or in other moral panderings. Even the names of the characters are there to beat you over the head with Wolfe's point: the sniveling sycophant named Peepgas (honest, I'm not making this up), or the successful black lawyer, Roger White, who is challenged by his ""blacker than thou"" friend, the Mayor of Atlanta. Ultimately, the ending is beyond disappointment. My advice: read the first 1/2, then put it down and imagine your own ending. You'll be much happier than if you suffer through the last 300-400 pages.",

Better to get the Middle Earth Atlas book. The ""soundtrack"" after about 15 minutes was reduced to the same short musical phrase over and over and over...I wanted to tear my hair out. Only redeemed by the thoughtful insite of a few commentators. If you have not read the books it will entice you to read them (if the theatrical movies haven't). Peter Jackson is not on this DVD as an other reviewer implied. It does have bits of JRR himself. The Biography was good but also is on other DVDs. The Brothers Hildebrandt discuss their paintings but it would have been better if lead by an interviewer..they do babble on a bit. Quality of the DVD does not do the artwork justice (you need to see them in print). A bit of a teaser to get the viewer to learn and see more.",

"__label__2 Nice model: This is a nice model when studying botany with younger children. I would have liked for the flower to have been made of a bit more sturdy material, but it will last through out study so it is fine. We used this in a science club with younger kids (ages 6 and younger) and they enjoyed being able to ""see"" inside a flower. The kids were a bit young to really understand what they saw when looking at a real flower through a microscope, so this one definitely fit the bill. I gave it four starts instead of five because while it is great for young children, it was a bit too simple at some points. Having a bit more information would have been nice as well as a good educational insert which would have been doable for the price.",

We spent two hours being bounced from one person to another; our call got dropped three times(!); we will have to pay for shipping the dead unit in; and at the very, very end it turned out that they were out of stock for replacements AND WOULD NOT ISSUE AN RMA UNTIL THEY GOT IT BACK IN STOCK. In other words: just sit around, keep calling back; we can't even send in the dud until they are good and ready.I think next time, I'll try another vendor.If you do decide to buy this unit, consider buying two.

But i never knew that he had a purely instrumental album out there, and with Antonia Carlos Jobim to boot. This was part of the Exotic culture that your grandparents were into in the early 60's. My favorite track has to be the Girl From Impanema, practically a standard in the early to mid 60's. This is nice as background music for a quiet dinner party, or if you're just sitting back and reading from your Kindle that you got from Amazon.

I have it tilted slightly because she cannot sit fully upright yet. It is easy to clean; there are no little crevices where the seat meets the sides (unlike another brand). The chair is very sturdy on my kitchen chair, which has a little padding. I also like that it is wide - more stability. It is hard but not impossible for me to tilt so I am not worried that it will move while my daughter is sitting in it. We don't use the tray yet because my daughter is rather small, and I don't care for the toys.",

With that being said, this book is beyond terrible. Burroughs is extremely distasteful in his descriptions of a family that took him in from his off-her-rocker mother and humiliated everyone who came into contact with him.

One moment you can't hear, and the next moment your'e being screached at.Problem 4: (Last and certainly not least) An annoying high-pitched set of tones is played between EVERY section.

First, you will soon be annoyed by the microphone 'ball' which dangles unnecessarily in front of your mounth. At this stage in audio technology, the microphone can be near the ear piece and still pick up and filter out appropriate sound. Second, there is no reason to have these in glow colors. If there is any thing that you don't want to 'show off' it is a headset. If you want to spend just a little money, check out the AT&T 90800 headset. It works very well and is dirt cheap. If you want more comfort and really plan to use this device, go with the Plantronics M175 -- I think it is worth the price difference and have used multiple units over the past 3 years.",

She will only sleep in my arms on those occasions. In desperation, I have had to let her cry, something I swore I would never do. I blame this book. I didn't know how good I had it. I also think it is highly irresponsible and somewhat cruel to go into such graphic, heart wrenching detail about what a baby *might* feel upon waking in the night. Where are the facts backing up her statements?I wish I had never bought this book, and I recommend that anyone considering this so-called solution get the book out of their local library rather than throwing money away on a purchase.

It is sad to see what passes for gay literature these days. Save your money. This is one piece of pulpy fiction without much in the way of redeeming value. The sex scenes are not even gratifying.

It has allowed me to play with two people and I have not had any problems with it.

The title track is a popular live track but I find it a little bit boring and overrated...still, it's a classic.

There are funny parts, sad parts, twists and turns, and a little romance thrown in for edge-of-your-seat reading before the Titanic sinks. Margaret is a fourteen-year-old from England who is going to join her brother in America. She lived at an orphanage for girls run by nuns, and is chosen by Sister Catherine as a companion for Mrs. Carstairs and her dog. It is very exciting, especially the parts about the Titanic just before it sank. A wonderful book!",

What I do is, when it is fully extended, I just put my left hand under the end of the lens to balance, and it's as easy as that.I only have it 3 days and I'm really enjoying it. My images are sharp!The only thing I did was change the contrast on my camera, which had been set to HIGH, to NORMAL.....The ""sun shade"" is a must in bright light, and really works well.If I chose to mount on my tripod, I have no problems.

This is an awful movie. It tries to be psychological by constantly bombarding the view with shaky images of bloody stuff. The movie steals all the clich√©s of Asylum movies and throws in a few scenes where high school level acting is attempted. If you want a better Lovecraftian adaptation, check out the movie Dagon. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Oh. . .one more thing the special effects guy should study a bit more anatomy the gross scenes would be more scary and realistic.",

I have now used it on my own creation which I cook on a stone and on a pizzeria-bought pie that needed re-slicing. Cut through them both like butter. The size does not get in the way and you really don't even have to press down too hard because of the solid weight of this ""pizza wheel"". I am very satisfied but I removed one star due to the fact that the wheel/blade cannot be removed. It would have been fairly easy for Oxo to make this product with a removable blade for thorough cleaning and for ease of sharpening. I'm disappointed about this. If the bushing or rivet fails down the road, I will probably design my own removable replacement. Last but not least, I really appreciate the quality of Oxo products. I've got a kitchen full of them.",

The problem here is not the cast or the performance, but the shoddy job of transcribing done for this recording. Besides being poorly remastered, it is running fast, a whole half-step high in pitch which distorts the voices of the principals, making them sound pinched and nasal which they were not. Shame on Gebhardt, which is usually very consistent in their reissues, for miserably botching this recording. Unless you have a variable speed cd player I would suggest you stay away from this one!",

While it has a count down timer, it would be nice if that could be made to be continuous as opposed to restarting it each time. If it was continuous it would be helpful for making rounds by reminding you each time the rounds were to be started. It does lose 3 or 4 seconds every month or so. Also found it interesting that you should not push the buttons when it is in the water, probably has something to do with sealing out the water. The display appears slightly larger than the older Casio even though they are the same physical size, so easier to read and helps when I am running.",

Seeing them put to terminology that I can use was so very helpful, and his willingness to be vulnerable and talk about his own history helps a reader to feel invested in the work he's doing.

I personally can vouch for the quality and insight into a family with a child who suffers from a very strange disease. And the value that Terry's words contain and the spirit Terry inscribes with visual images and witty dialogue within it's chapters are heart stopping. Terry Trueman excels at not just being a poet but being an author with a spectacular range of emotion. I can only imagine how the movie will shake and rattle an audience.,

"__label__2 Unussually entertaining hig school romance: This movie is not perfect, but it has moments of poignant romance and others of absolute hiliarity. Kirsten Dunst was wonderful. This movie is a semi-musical farce. I mean farce in its proper usage: not a term of derision but rather the highest and hardest form of comedy (as distinguished from satire for instance). Or put it this way- Shakespeare-s comdies are farces. Except maybe for the Merry Wives of Windsor. A good farce is very very hard to do. And there are moments when this film descends into Burlesque- and others when the humor gets clunky. Despite its uneveness this is still an immensly entertaining film. Even the minor supporting characters are a hoot (Ed Begley jr and Swoozie Kurts as the parents of our haplessly infatuated hero, for instance).",

I can't say about her other books since this is the only one of hers I've ever read. I'm sorry, but I was so irritated by the writer's inaccurate reactions to the human behaviours.

I then ordered another copy of the film (from another source) manufactured by Terra Studio (which is also available from Amazon).

I've listened to it 4-5 times over, and it sounds especially good in the surround-sound environment of my car (using my car CD player). I'd say it is a gem of my hundreds-of-classical-cds collection.

If you like slow moving anime and not a ton of action this is for you... if your looking for Fist of Northstar anime this is probably not for you. The best comparison I can make is probably Aeon Flux.,

I haven't run across any bugs or problems of any kind. maybe other people hadn't applied the updater or maybe their computer wasn't up to the challenge or maybe I just don't do the same things they do but my experience has been troublefree. I use the program in conjunction with Coldfusion MX 7(also by Macromedia) and the integration work well, too. Maybe if people that talk it down could be more specific rather than just saying ""it's buggy"" I could test out their issues and see if I can duplicate their problems",

__label__1 Too big for comfort: I bought this for my wife who was uncomfortable with her pregnancy while sleeping. Once opened it can not be returned but in the box it is folded so it was hard to tell its size. It is huge and she complained about it after trying it for only a few moments. She wanted me to return it but it was opened and I decided not to. She tried it the other night for a full night and was not real happy. On another note her 17yr old cat likes it so if you want a 55 dollar cat pillow it was worth it.,
"__label__1 A sad Disappointment: I have used this razor for a month now, and finally went back to a rotary razor to get a good shave. I followed the directions on how to use the new razor, and all I got out of it was a nice facial massage. The razor seemed like it did not have any cutting blades in it. I pulled my skin tight and the razor just rode over facial hair like it was not there. To put it simply, the razor does not cut my beard. The razor is a sad disappointment. It looks good, fits my hand well, it just wont cut my beard.",

It didn't leak or anything, so it was good in that aspect. Since I didn't need such a long hose I was able to just cut it off where the kink was and it's working now. I just can't use the attachment at one end, but it serves it's purpose for me. I guess other people get different colors of this hose and some seem to be better than others.",
"__label__2 poetry in the everday: I love the combination of singable melodies and clever (and sometimes even thought-provoking) words. Winston Clark's perfect arrangements and impeccable piano accompaniment provide highlights both for the wonderful (and, let's face it, some not-so-wonderful) songs. I have listened to ""I Love a Lad"" about two dozen times, and it still gives me goosebumps when she sings ""and one day it will sift away."" What a choice of words!",
"__label__1 In a word...: Tedious. It's rare that I speed through a book solely for the purpose of getting to the end of it so I can throw it down and get to a better book, but this was certainly the case with ""Lunch"". This formula has been done before, more engagingly and intricately, by better writers. The author's attempt at provocation fails miserably and the book reads like an over-dramatized romance novel with a buffoon for a central character. The author also has a tendency to build up to nothing which I first noticed in ""Belladonna"", (which was, nevertheless, better written and more engaging than ""Lunch"", due to the narrator's viewpoint of the story and a more developed plot and central characters). This novel may have been quite the scandal if it were written in 1940, but it certainly doesn't cut it today. Lunch? No thanks.",
"__label__1 Don't waste your time or money: This is not ""investigative reporting."" The book is filled with nonsense. The author did not do any basic research into the teachings or traditions of the Holy Catholic Church.

Catholic Sisters came from Europe and immediately went to the Civil War battlefields nursing soldiers from the north and south.

This is only a problem if you are using multiple video sources.Second, Most laptop computers (I tried a compaq with high end ATI, a dell with intel graphics chip and an HP with Nvidia) simply will not detect the TV through this box. I returned it and got another and they still did not work. All three of these laptops worked instantly with the same setup and a different brand box.",
"__label__1 Great workout, but not the one I wanted.: No fault to Schwinn, but the shipping department at Amazon needs to make serious changes when deciding their carrier (in this case, UPS)The bike took 2 weeks to arrive, and when it did, the box was torn up. Finally, when I opened the thing, there was a huge crack around the pedal area, making the bike useless. I spent 2 hours putting everything back in the destroyed box, used up an entire roll of tape and some rope. Finally, I asked for Amazon to pick up the return package, but unfortunately they chose UPS again.UPS lost the return package, but Amazon gave me my refund, so no hard feelings towards Amazon.In total, I think I burned about 500 calories in the 6 weeks return order and refund.I think almost all of the 1-star reviews on this bike have to do with shipping, and I hate to be one of those guys; but BUYER BEWARE WHEN PURCHASING HEAVY EXERCISE EQUIPMENT ONLINE.",

While I admit that I used to enjoy these films for the action and explosive violence as a kid, I have seen so many as an adult that they bore me to no end. Arnold isn't so bad, it is just that the story is unbelievably banal.Not recommended, unless you want to waste 2 hours, which at times is exactly what I would want to do, that is, with a good movie.",

__label__2 Just Great......Again!: When I was growing up MASH just didn't do it for me. I was just to young to grasp all the subtle humor. Now being an adult I cannot pass up a chance to see this masterful classic. I recommend this series to everyone. I only wish that they would make the production of each season a little faster.

If you take a heart, a liver, two kidneys, two corneas, and bone marrow from a willing donor with a known execution date, and you can save quite a few lives with his death.It's common-sense arguments like these, not grisly death-obsession, that makes this book worth reading. I expect that some readers will find the sections on euthanasia distasteful, but the subject is handled carefully and smartly.For all his faults, Kevorkian is a strong and articulate voice who is too often written off automatically as a crank and a murderer. Read this book in order to balance your perspective, then judge him if you wish.",

Each crew member brings something different with ruff and rugged flows to more mellow, whiny tones. On the production end, jazzy sounds dominate with the constant inclusion of cutting and scratching. ""Little Shirts"" is the ""fine lady"" track which is real smooth and will stick in your head like glue. Not only do the group represent Hip-Hop in it's purest state, but they expand on what the Black Eyed Peas and Jurassic 5 started. Very promising debut that will launch LA Symphony into the Hip-Hop arena.",

Far worse than usual delmark live records from the 60s and 70s.

"__label__2 Coming back into fashion subject matter: I discovered this book after reading the recent obituary on J.F. Powers. Now I'm recommending it to everyone. Father Urban is a priest who sounds more like a rotary member, a fund-raiser, a PR man. When the powers that be send him to the hinterlands, he bows to the inevitable. Other victories seem to turn on him at the same time. Hob-knobbing with the weathly, which at first seemed to benefit his order, turns into a nightmare in which he remembers his duty at just the last minute. This prose is so dryly humorous you must read it carefully to catch it all. You will become enchanted with Father Urban and sorry to leave him at the story's end. I wanted this story to go on and on.",

Well, I guess I did want to jump out of my seat... and go see another movie! It starts off slow and unfortunately that is the way it ends. It is filmed like a documentary, but I have seen scarier things watching the Discovery Channel. And compared to Jaws...pulleeezz, this movie does not compare. The only thing that was really scary was the acting. The reviewers who gave this movie high ratings may have been distracted by the full frontal nudity in the first 10 minutes, and like the woman in this film I also wished for death by the end.",

"__label__1 Killer Tomatoes Eat France: Professor Gangreen and his gang of killer tomatoes take off to Europe to fulfill an ancient prophecy that would make his idiotic assistant, Igor, the new king of France, leaving it up to Michael and everyone's favorite Fuzzy Tomato to stop their evil plan! Get ready for more Grade-A cheese in KILLER TOMATOES EAT FRANCE, the fourth and final film in the KILLER TOMATOES franchise. John De Bello and friends put their own silly spin on The Man in the Iron Mask, with series favorite Steve Lundquist playing out the duel roles as both Igor and the future king, Louis the XXVII. The tomatoes have retained their animated features from the third film for more goofy fun as they take to the stage in a rocking music number before heading out to the battlefields to squash more humans. The groan-worthy gags and outlandish humor still make for more guilty entertainment, while you can expect every possible French clich√© to be properly exploited.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",

She's a woman that every woman can identify with on some level and you watch her grow up, get smart and concoct the BEST revenge you could ever imagine. She goes from being homely and timid to being strong, ambitious, shrewd, smart, plotting and a real diva.Sure wish there was a ""Butterfly"" club where I live!

Does that have anything to do with the plot?Then once, when Kinsey went out for dinner, she says she passed McDonald's for one and went to a ""competitor's fast food restaurant."" What, she's not allow to include the words ""Burger King""??Pondering the possibility of product placement even began to distract me from the admittedly already weak story.Also, these stories have become period pieces, so locked as they are in the 1980s with typewriters and pay phones. Of course, to speed Kinsey ahead 15 years or so would mean that Henry would have passed on. So she's utterly locked into the time frame.",

The only problem I've had with them is that since the silicone has begun to really form to my ears, they tend to either wander out of the canals or get stuck in there.

"__label__1 not bashing the album, just explaining it: I think this album is terrible. Not musically, but just as a matter of taste. It is much slower and more trebly than the black metal I usually prefer. however, it is really evil sounding and displays a lot of musical talent. So my review serves to inform, not to critique. Honestly, everybody has different tastes in music and metal, so I'm just trying to help people potentially avoid my mistake. The other reviews on here didn't really paint a good picture of the sound and I bought it thinking it would be fast and viking-esque. Anyway, it's mostly really slow and heavy, with a lot of echo and haunting vocals. So, if you can imagine a slow version of Mayhem's ""Wolf's Lair Abyss"" CD (really, really, slow, that is), that is KIND OF a good idea what this sounds like.",

Gone are the hypotnotic eurphoric rhythems that DJ Taucher is trademark for. The first CD is nothing but europop garbage. Some of the tracks sounded so outdated like they were recorded in the early 90's. The second CD features a varity of chillout tracks that are barely mediocre. Taucher should have kept the CD in Europe and not bothered releasing it in the U.S. Hide Tide, Low Tide serves as a very bad example of what I think Taucher is truely capable of.

Though some of the essays deal with scientific issues (e.g. physics, cosmology, black holes) most of the book is autobiographical in nature discussing the author?s upbringing and struggle with ALCS.Written in the aftermath of the popular A Brief history of the Universe, the current work is a rather blatant effort to exploit Hawking's popularity with minimum effort. Although a short book (approx. 175 hardcover) there is much repetition amongst the essays. Readers with even a passing knowledge of Hawking will find no new information in this book.Overall, a disappointing book that has little to offer. Only for the most dedicated Hawking aficionado.",

They don't sit flush when they are closed and therefore overlap slightly.Also, the astronauts do not fit in the shuttle which really doesn't make sense.It's a little bit heavy, and because it's made of metal I worry that it could be dangerous if someone is too rough with it, especially the pieces that come to a point.I wouldn't buy it again, and I wouldn't recommend it.",

It provides excellent reproduction of the full range of sound.2. They don't fall out of your ears. Not once.3.

Another reviewer mentioned wind noise but I don't find this to be any different than my old ear buds.5.

Curiously, however, others are omitted in favor of tales that, though quite good, simply don't seem to be part of the KIY cycle.

I still have the bridge component to the other one, so hopefully swapping it will give me one working pair of headphones and one very broken pair.Other than the durability issues, this is a great headset.

The repairman said to add the liquid first, and then add the fruit through the hole in the lid while the motor was running because the blades don't grind frozen fruit--they cause it to ""explode"". I took the repaired blender home, where it made 2 or 3 good fruit smoothies before going back to its old trick of not blending the frozen fruit again. It will still make shakes with ice cream and the like, but forget the fruit smoothies. So I guess I'll be going back to the repair shop and seeing what can be done--or asking for a replacement.",

The chewy cherries are OK, but the bananas are really tough to chew. With the apples I'm satisfied with one bag, but with the bananas and cherries it takes two bags. I'm sorry I didn't stick with the apples. I was really disappointed. If I had read the reviews first I probably wouldn't have ordered them. Live and learn.",
"__label__1 Only Karajan completists need apply: This is by far the weakest of Karajan's 4 (!) recorded Beethoven cycles. The performances and orchestra are rather bland, and the sound quality is quite bad, with significant tape hiss and muddled frequency ranges throughout -- perhaps if this were 20-bit remastered to current standards, it would be more competitive. Only recommended for those who *must* have all 4 of Karajan's sets -- it's not truly terrible, by any stretch, but it's mediocre, and at this price you can do far better elsewhere.If you're looking for a ""vintage"" (1940's or earlier) Beethoven set, try Furtwangler (my personal fave), or perhaps Toscanini. For beginners who just want to hear Karajan's Beethoven, stick with his middle 2 cycles -- both the 60s and 70s sets are outstanding.",
"__label__2 The next turn...: Depeche Mode redefined themselves once again with this release, adopting ""real"" instruments, going so far as Alan Wilder's learning to play the drums. While this release doesn't pack the song for song punch as it's predecessor ""Violator"" did, the style makes this a more interesting album. It's this constant reinvention that has kept Depeche Mode around for nearly 20 years.As for the songs, my current favorites are ""Condemnation"", ""Mercy in You"", ""One Caress"", and ""Walking in my Shoes"". This, to me, is the third major turning point in the band (the first being after ""Speak and Spell"" and the second being around ""Some Great Reward"" and ""Black Celebration""). While this album is good, their subsequent release, ""Ultra"", is superior in almost every way and a strong contender with ""Violator"" for DM's top album.I like all of DM's music and it's this varying style that makes them one of the most interesting bands of the era.",
"__label__2 Rock Memories: I'm giving the Rock Almanac: Top 20 American and British Singles and Albums of the '50s, '60s, and 70s five stars because it is a great trip down memory lane.

The book compiles a listing of all artists who hit both the UK & American singles and albums charts from 1964-1973 and the chart position of those songs and albums.",
"__label__2 Excellent Comeback: This is a very good album. Cold were having some issues a while back, the singer in rehab and the guitarist leaving the band for Evanescence. In my experience very few bands make albums as good as the last one. Although not quite as good as ""Year of the Spider"", it is still a very good album especially considering the things they've been through. My personal favorite track - ""Ocean""",
"__label__2 Just plain comfy!: I requested (and received) a pair of these last Christmas in the ""Cognac"" color. Wow. I found them to be so comfy that I went out and bought another pair for myself in black!I especially like to wear slip-on shoes when flying ... easy to get them off and on quickly when going through security; and then, after we're airborne I can slip them off my feet and put them back on before landing without having to reach down or lean forward! Makes for a more relaxing flight.The 'gator' finish is a nice distinction, too. Highly recommended. VERY comfy.",

I loved the stories behind the coins, and the large images of the front and back of each great coin.Early last year I gave away this book, and am sorely missing the beauty of it for a year now. I have looked through Jeff Garrett's Encyclopedia of Gold Coins at the local bookstore, and strangely, I find that this book is way better. The Encyclopedia feels more like an oversized Redbook, while this item feels like a great work of art.I am looking forward to receiving the new 3rd Edition. I called Whitman Books and their customer service rep told me that it should be ready by Dec. 20th. As to when it will be ready from Amazon, I do not know. But I am truly looking forward to the new 3rd Edition.",

How can we, as individuals of society, allow such a talent-less wannabe rapper become so successful, simply because he was a dug dealer who got shot nine times. Fine, if the muic actually had ubstance i would understnad, but it simply doesn't. The tracks all sound the same, in their profane, mysoginistic and voilent way. 50 cent simply doesn't have the interllectual capability to write anything slighlty meaningful or sinifcant, and will hopefully be forgotten with tomorrow's waste.A good beat does not justify an album's existence. This is ghetto trash, which shouldn't be glorified, or worse, brought into our own homes.For real rap music, with meaning, purchase LIL KIM's new album 'The Naked Truth'.",

Cheesy to the extreme, 90's CGI, absurd script, pointless drivel. DEMONS was a ""there is nothing else out to rent this week"" rental.

I agree with the first three reviews written ( that is as far as I read ). Each individual said what I would have. This album brings a refreshing, light, dynamic sound that seems to have been lost over the years in the new wave of pop art. I have yet to skip a song. The influences are obvious and you won't be disappointed to hear that familiar sound in these BTE songs. I absolutely LOVE this album.

The material is highly compressed and assumes that the reader is among the 1000 most skilled people in the world in this area and is totally knowledgable in the state of the art of six months ago and earlier. It therefore leaves out things that a new learner in the area would need to know. This explains why there are so many copies available used and their low prices and their fine/unused condition.,

You can however put the phone in the holster with the lid open if you need to access the screen (e.g. I use this holster as part of my car mount).

David was certainly not anyone I've ever run across.His character was totally unbeleivable. Ms. Edwards needs to talk to more men. The passages relating to his photography were boring. Who cares???? I didn't egt the connection she was trying so desperately to make between David's passion for photography and his ""losses"".I had a hard time believing that Norah was suffering so VERY much yet since the death of her daughetr at birth, that when she finally meets her...she takes off to France w/ her new husband. Oh well..guess it's too late to have a relationship with my daughter whom I thought dead..which led to the destruction of every other relationship in my life. Ya, sure........ Not very beleivable.",

__label__2 More Ruby please: I figured out who the killer was early on but it didnt spoil the story. I really like China Bayles. She is cool. However if I could talk to Ms Albert I would ask her to please include more of the Ruby character and ease back on the Sheila!! I think Ruby rocks!! But I liked this book and I like this series. The herb info is cool too. I am reading these in order so I have a few more to go. I have enjoyed them all.,
__label__2 A wonderful book full of wise knowledge for young and old: This book is wonderful. Don't let the reading age level stop you from sharing this book with a younger child. My 7 year old son and I would read several chapters nightly. We both loved the book and the time we spent together. There is wise knowledge in this book for both the young and old. We hated to end it. Now we can't wait to read the next one!!!!!,
__label__1 A train wreck: This book started out good but got horrible after that. It reminded me of a second rate soap opera. I only gave it two stars because it was good enough to finish reading. It creates intrigue but once you find out what happens it like are you serious. The second book is even worse.,

__label__1 Only lasted a few minutes after charge was complete: Bought the Rio Nitrus after reviewing them and seeing there were great reviews along with the bad ones. I guess you could add us to the list of the dreaded upgrader message. Downloaded a couple of books and songs and then wanted to test it with a fm transmitter and it wouldn't turn on. Just clicked away and got hot. Hate to tell the guy who said just use the reset button... must have tried that 10 times. Finally have given up and returning it. starting the search again!!!,

They provided great communication and cooperation. When the ZipLinq arrived, it worked fine. I use it to connect my MP3 player to my car stereo. ZipLinq provides a secure connection at both ends, it is easy to adjust the length of the cable and the sound quality is excellent. The retracting cable works smoothly and it makes storage easy and convenient. I hope it lasts a long time.",

I was very excited when he released ""Wanted"" and bought it right away...only to regret not listening to it first. Cliff's voice is still as charming as it 's always been, but the tracks were heavily produced (using too many instruments and unnecessary background vocals) and every song sounds the same! This version of Elvis' classic ""All Shook Up"" stands out as the worst of this bad bunch.The whole album simply sounds like some cheap stuff from the 80's. What was Cliff thinking? It 's just very bad and very disappointing!!!",
"__label__2 Spider-Man is back!!!: After Spider-Man 3 I was SO glad to hear that they were going to reboot the series! I don't know who thought that garbage (Spider-Man 3) would be good, but it literally made my worst movies of all time list! I was never a big Toby McGuire (sp?) fan, and I think Andrew Garfield plays a MUCH better Peter Parker. My only complaint about this movie is that they had to rush through the origin portion of the story. Since the origin of Spider-Man had already been established in the previous films, that part of the story seems rushed and incomplete here. Had this been the first Spider-Man movie, and the film would have had the opportunity to develop a better origin, I feel like it could have been the best Spider-Man movie yet. However, they could be saving part of the origin story for the sequels.",

"__label__2 ""Chop, Chop the King, the King!!!"": All I can say is WOW! I was amazed when I rented this film and put this into my dvd player. The costumes, make up, and the acting are all SUPERB! I could tell that a lot of thought went into making this quality movie.Indeed I am a patriotic American and I do know that George III is to blame for our American Revolution, but I felt sympathetic towards the King in this film.Underneath the savage, rigid, and tempermental ""insanity"" of the King, George III did indeed have a heart and a conscious that can be seen in bits and pieces in many scenes. I actually found the Prince of Wales (Prince Regent) to be a ruthless snake that was King in ""name only.""There are some great scenes and shots of Windsor Castle, the Houses of Parliament, and St Paul's Cathedral. Compared to the real and dysfunctional House of Windsor, George III and the House of Hanover will give you a real Royal treat in this film!",
"__label__1 Confusing and Repetitive: I am still not sure of the point Mr. Graham is trying to make. I don't know if he's sure why he wrote the book in the first place. He certainly does a lot of name-dropping. There has always been, and will always be, class distinction based upon income, education, family history, physical features, etc. It happens in every race and culture, and I am not surprised that it happens in the African-American race. I believe that many of the organizations that Mr. Graham allude to in his book were initially formed as ""support systems"" for those few Blacks who became educated and successful. During the early years, these organizations were probably nothing more than social clubs. But over years, I believe that many of the organizations' members have re-identified their main purpose and developed a social conscience. I hope that those of us who have blessed to find any degree of success and happiness, must realize that of ""much is given, much is expected"".",
"__label__2 Works As Advertised: I recently purchased two units, one for a 6-inch jointer and the other for a 10 inch contractor's tablesaw whose factory-supplied mobile base didn't last. Both units assembled quickly and operate smoothly and silently. Package includes spare nuts & bolts in case a few get lost. These bases make a small shop workable, allowing effortless machine movement to accomodate material & workflow, facilitate clean-up, and change arrangement to accomodate new ""toys."" Caveat: Unless you have help to lift heavy machines into the assembled bases, it is necessary to assemble the bases around the machine; however, by tilting the machine up on a few 2 x 4 blocks, there is plenty of ground clearance to do that easily. A well-designed, simple, durable product that works as advertised.",

"__label__2 Vince Clarke has the Midas touch: From Depeche Mode to Yaz to Erasure, everything Vince Clarke touches turns to gold. This compilation provides all the evidence necessary to bestow upon Clarke the title ""synth god"".The biggest hits are ""Little Respect"" and ""Who Needs Love (Like That)"", but each song stands on its own as a great New Wave composition, based on the powerful and unique vocals of Andy Bell and the fantastic synthesizer soundscapes (all 100% analog!) of Clarke.""Victim of Love"" (my fave), ""Oh L'Amour"", and ""Stop!"" are other highlights on this CD, which is well worth the money for any fan of 80s music.One other note: Erasure has had several albums after the release of this compilation (most notably the masterpiece ""I Say, I Say, I Say"", in 1994), so ""Pop! 20 Hits"" cannot be said to be representative of their career as a whole. Still, it's worth owning for its summary of the band's first decade of production.",

The company calls these ""Universal"" magazines. They are used in Thompson .22-caliber guns as well as a number of others."" Unfortunately, the Thompson in .22LR is no longer being made. Hence the 30-round magazine are no longer made as well. And without a magazine, a machine pistol becomes a single shot weapon. So the design in the book is basically outdated right out of the gate. If you can find/obtain a 30 round, .22LR magazine from another manufacturer (or can make one yourself) and then modify the measurements of the lower receiver to accept the new magazine, then you might find this book a worthwhile purchase.",

Well the book is about a war going on in Denmark, that is were they live. They are taking away all of the jews and so people are hiding them in there houses. So that is a little about the book. I rated this book a 4, because sometimes in the book I would be confused on what was going on. Like the author did not really explain some of the things as well as she could of.

The information provided gives us valuable insight into the aesthetic principles of these great dancers and teachers. This should be useful to all dancers, whether they teach or not. Some very esoteric facts can be found here as well, such as why Balanchine likes the fingers and hands held the way he does and why many don't like it that way.

"__label__2 The Coen brother's are back: I had a bad christmas and was sick of the drama. I wasn't sure what to expect from the movie ,because burn after reading was so terrible( in my opinion). And no country for old men was well written, but the ending left me angry. This film plays like a spaghetti/western/comedy believe it or not. Jeff Bridges doesn't even try to be John Wayne, instead he plays the part like a skilled comedian ,but treads softly enough with the jokes so as not to become cartoonish. All throughout the movie, they play differant versions of leaning on the everlasting arms.Which is a interesting foil to the violent story unfolding on screen. The only complaint I have is Matt Damon, who I usually like is very annoying, and I kept wishing his character would die already.I smell an oscar nomination or two for Bridges or the very BRILLIANT young Ms. Steinfeld,(Mattie Ross) I think is she plays her cards right,she could end up in the ranks of Meryl Streep.",

I have never heard a CD, until this one, that sounds like all the instruments are fighting to have the loudest part. The keyboard pieces don't even fit in with the rest of the music. I have heard quite a few black metal artists succesfully combine keyboards with rock but Mushroom head sounds like they have a keyboarder just so their buddy who plays keyboard can be in the band. What a waste of my twelve dollars. Don't waste your time on this overhyped piece of [junk]. I sold mine at a local used cd store two hours after I bought it. The funny thing is, on the rack there were already two used copies. Seems I'm not the only one with this opinion. Save your money and buy the new system of a down when it comes out.",

Yes, the music is not be technically superb in most ways but they did have some very original ideas on this CD like the guitar playing of Ace Frehely and the little boy voice- very cute. One of the finer songs on the CD is ""Hard Luck Woman"" written by Peter Criss. Peter is a terrific drummer. He's no Carl Parlmer but then Carl Palmer was no Peter Criss.

In the middle of taking a photo about a month after purchase, the front of the lens literally fell to the ground. I could not believe it came apart. This also damaged my Tiffen UV Protector filter.

Well, it is not even close. Micro SD slot under the original cover on Etrex Venture CX is preventing the cover from this windshield mount to fit. You would think that SOEMONE form Garmin would test this BEFORE they include it as an accessory that should fit CX Venture, but we were wrong. Perhaps Garmin just does not have enough smart people, because you really need to be a rocket scientist to see the difference between the two battery covers.",
"__label__1 Overpriced and overweight: I bought this bike for my three and a half year old son, as he was outgrowing his 12"" bicycle. I should have physically examined it before buying it.The bike is *heavy* which makes it hard to peddle. It comes with the flimsiest training wheels I've ever seen--just plastic disks. I had to buy some aftermarket training wheels to make it rideable. It also came with a useless front brake (the pads didn't even touch the rim) which I just removed, and lots of plastic pieces which were dragging on the chain.For $110, I was hoping this would be a better bike than a standard 16"" child's bike. It isn't. Either save your money and buy a cheaper bike, or spend another $70 to get a truly better bike by a company like Specialized.",

"__label__1 Not terrible: This movie was ""okay"" but if I hadn't been from Hawaii, I doubt if it would have held my interest. If you are from Hawaii, don't expect all the characters to be authentic - seems like they had mainland actors trying to act like locals. The acting and the script were sub-par. Fortunately, I watched on TV so I could turn away whenever the racing part was not on. Who wants to watch typical adolescent conversations if they can avoid it? This is one of those stupid PG movies that will not hold an adult's interest but they throw in some bad words and a middle finger so you wouldn't want your kids to watch it.",

I have to confess, I initially bought it because I liked the cover! But then something strange happened when I tried to read it -- I couldn't put the book down. I was so caught up in the tale of Firebird and Brennen that I read it from cover to cover in almost 1 sitting.I was not disappointed with the new version. All of the characters that I liked so much were intact, and given extra dimensions to their personalities. I plan to read Fusion Fire (the sequel) as soon as possible.",

The book could have also benefited from better editing, as there were many inconsistencies.",

Several questions ran through my mind: how does a person continue to live with any humanity at all after such an experience; why does one person live, while all the rest die; what kind of magnetism did Mira have that encouraged people to help her?I've met Mira; she lives here in my home town of Oak Ridge. She will speak before my class. Perhaps my questons will be answered, and I will know who Mira is after all.",

When my house was for sale, I used it everyday and the house had a nice scent. I moved to a two story house, and didn't think it would scent as much of the house. I placed it in my entryway near the stairs and it scents most of the downstairs and upstairs from that location. I am impressed and very glad that I have it.",

"__label__1 JUST SAY NO TO DRUGS!: I love books on this type of subject.....except this one. It held my interest for the first few chapters, then it seemed to be just rambling episodes of psychedelic ""flashbacks"" that are passed off as communications with other beings from other dimensions. The author even admits that some of these episodes may be his own beliefs played out through the hallucinogen. I don't think one ""enlightened"" person mentioned in the book had ""higher"" experiences without the aid of some kind of hallucinogenic drug. I'm opened minded about the existence of UFO's, crop circles and aliens, other dimensions, etc., but this book in no way furthers my belief in any of those things. The author has obviously done way to much experimenting with psychedelics for this book to be taken as anything even close to credible.",

"__label__2 Bush Bashing.: Mr. Moore writes about the issues with the Bush family and the ethics of the US government towards the World before and after 9/11. Most of his points are backed up with research; some points seemed bias especially concerning corporations and the government. I do agree with most of his points although would recommend readers to do their own research beforehand. I thought this book deserved 4-stars, since Mr. Moore kept pushing the same point towards the Bush family and thought he should have expanded more on the other government officials he mentioned in the book.On a side note, I just saw his movie ""Roger & me"", which depicts the Flint city falling apart due to GM leaving the city; this movie also shows how Mr. Moore started his journey. It is good for the American society to see a different point of view from the ones we see on public TV and some newspapers. Looking forward to watch his newest movie ""Fahrenheit 911"".

"__label__2 Well Sung Mozart at 12: This is a libretto by an experienced writer of comic opera with a score by a uniquely talented 12 year old. Let us not compare it with what what the mature Mozart could do with the stimulus of an outstanding writer like DaPonte.Still as a traditional romantic farce, when well sung, it can be quite enjoyable. This production is typical of the Mozart 22 set, updating and revising words and music to fit the conception of the production staff. I did not object to the intent but found that it did not work in performance. No fault of the singer/actors; they made the most of what they were given vocally; what they were given to act, was however, to me, often written and staged to be a singular distraction from the operatic core.Clearly, viewers differ as to that judgment. If one is selecting but one DVD to buy, the reader will have to make his/her own predilections in making a choice. Happily more than one approach is available.",

This one, slim and incisive, is a masterpiece of understatement. The tale of Jacob Hansen's life and losses soon after the Civil War, when the town of Friendship is stricken by both a diphtheria epidemic and a raging forest fire, is exquisitely simple but remarkably powerful. I haven't stopped thinking about this book since I finished reading it. I marvel at how much O'Nan manages to convey without ever being explicit. Love, tragic loss, and survival against all odds are the interwoven strands of the theme. Life lessons compressed into one short book. This is a very special novel, written by a wonderfully gifted writer.",

The carafe's design is disappointing. Although it does not drip, the configuration is annoying: the handle is open at the botton (not a good idea if one wants to clean it in a dishwasher); the rim collects water inside and outside so that hand-washing necessitates hand drying.

But, as Michael Crichton said about Henry James, ""I can't stand Henry James. His stuff reads like a first draft."" Conrad writes like Henry James here in that the sentences are eternal and convoluted, and take forever to make a point. And every little thing in LORD JIM is symbolic of...you name it: man's despair, etc. As I said, I love Conrad: HEART OF DARKNESS, NOSTROMO, his short stories.

Maybe I just didn't have much time, and decided to only listen to the songs I KNEW I liked. I really don't remember.But I finally gave this CD a real listen a few months ago, and damn, it is good. This is sing-a-long, feel good rock and roll, with an old time British Rock sound....but harder. ""Hello"" is great way to open the CD, and I love the way ""Some Might Say"" begins. Great Guitars! My favorite songs on the album are probably ""Some Might Say"" and ""Morning Glory"", but I pretty much think whatever song I'm listening to at the time is my favorite! I could probably do without ""Cast No Shadow"" and ""She's Electric"", but overall, this is a solid CD.",

"__label__2 Awesome sound, but no a/c adapter.: I love this little speaker. Compared to the little one my son bought at Radio Shack, it has unbelievable sound quality. However, I paid only $17 on a Gold Box deal, so I am taking that into consideration. I would never pay retail, altho' some of you might think it is worth it to get this kind of bass. It is completely portable which makes my ipod so much more useable both in the car & at home. The only thing I am unhappy with is that no A/C adaptor is included. However, my husband said A/C adaptors are easy to get, so once I have that, you won't hear one more complaint from me.",

Not only does the urine not go away, but the smell is still there. I have tried soaking the area and letting it dry, I have sprayed, I have had the carpet professionally cleaned, and I think the only way to fix our problem is just to replace the carpet. I wish that rather than wasting $30 here and there trying this brand and that only to have the same bad result, I would have just put that money towards the new carpet fund! Bottom line, don't waste your money if you have CAT urine stains of any kind or old DOG urine stains.. The stuff just doesn't work. Just get the carpet replaced and start over.",

I liked that show but this book isn't funny or scary. It's really corny. I won't give away the ending [i skipped to the end and read it] but it's pretty silly.I guess all in all I thought this book could have been good if it wasn't so silly. it could have been good if it wasn't about dead people. that whole thing was kind of dumb. so I guess you should buy some other book.",

I would recommend getting their other two greatest hits so you get better coverage.",

In Knockout Kings 2001 - Boxers were able to enter with music, some of them even had them had their own dance. The overall gameplay was much more enjoyable. I just hope that if they do come out with a Knockout kings 2003, it would be in the format of 2001. Also with the addition of Felix Trinidad, Bernard Hopkins, Vladimir Klitshko... they should include Kosta Tsyzu. The only good thing about this game is that they took out David Reid. Other than that ...It's UGLY!",

"__label__1 A first effort, one to try and forgive?: ""The Publisher's Review"" was kind to end its assessment of the book with, ""...but a little silly.""""Silly"" began about page five and reappeared frequently during the remaining 285 pages. We're looking here at ""silly"" at the high school composition level, and the plot is strained and worse even than the writing.This was copywritten 13 years ago, and Littell has become a somewhat better writer in the interim. I just finished his latest, ""The Company,"" and it was worth about 3 1/2 stars. I'll skip anything else by him.The old phrase, ""the book's not worth the candle,"" is too kind for ""The Once and Future Spy.""",

Whenever he says anything she seems uncomfortable and just keep going without paying attention to him at all. And as he is shorter than her they look so funny.

"__label__1 Baby Talk: I must say, I was disappointed by King's latest work. One of my favorite things about his novels is the way he delves deep into the minds of his characters. For example, in ""IT"", he brought all of the intricate members of the Losers' Club to life.I found Lisey as a character surprisingly flat; Lisey herself didn't actually have a story, as the novel was centered around her late husband. I also found the 'secret language' between Scott and Lisey infuriatingly annoying and cutsy sounding, bordering on baby talk. It actually made me a bit embarrassed. A lot of the story was far fetched and unneccesarily disgusting (I know, I know, it IS Stephen King, but I mean in terms of this particular story and setting, a lot of it just seemed unnecessary and tacked in for impact).I'm happy for those of you who liked it, but this book wasn't for me. I'm going to go re-read ""IT"" now. ;)",

They sounded a hell of a lot like the Sisters, but were able to inject their own style to give it originality.Maybe, in a few years, She wants revenge will find the dark soul they are striving for.

"__label__2 This book suprised me: After reading all the reviews here on Amazon I decided to give this book a chance. I'm so glad I did because this book is an absolute gem. I know some people will be turned off by the magic used through the summoning of demons, but its light hearted and if anything the humans are far worse than the spirits they summon. That's one of the things I loved so much about the book was how no one was perfect. Most of the people in the book including the boy are selfish, cruel and arrogant, it's hilarious reading Bartimaeus's notes on his many observations of human behavior that oh so true. So if you're looking for a fresh and original book with a great story, and characters I highly recommend this book.",

I haven't met all of these citizens of the gay world in my 26 years as an out gay male much less in 30 minutes.I'm all for gay representation in any form, but this is not a flick for the gay community.

I thought for sure there was a 'To be continued' in my near future. I was shocked when the answers were supposedly crammed into a few short pages. Did Ms. Cornwell run up against a deadline?

This is because the CD was made from a really worn out tape, and the DVD-A is made from the original, better preserved master tapes. The fact that this CD and the DVD-A were released by the same company is one of the biggest anomalies I have come across in all my years of collecting music.Just to clarify based on some replies to my review; The sound quality comparisons I made go far, far beyond the expected differences in sound quality between the CD and DVD-A formats.

"__label__2 My favorite headphones!: I've been using these headphones for years! As with all headphones, the wires are subject to breakage when pulled, so I keep an extra pair or two available. They last for 2-3 months of fairly heavy usage. I listen to audiobooks and music while I'm ironing, cooking, knitting and walking. I started using this brand and style of headphones when the children were infants because the earpieces do not block sound. They just sit comfortably in the outer part of my ear. I've tried earpieces that came with my mp3 player, but I can't tolerate the irritation from having them in my ears. Heavier headphones flatten my hair and block sound. These are definitely my favorite headphones!",

"__label__1 Disappointing: By all means this is not a bad album. In fact, if they had never produced anything else, it would be amazing. However, Bardo Pond have always been trailblazers in the realm of psychedelic rock, each album contributing new sounds to their bag of tricks. I remember being amazed at how many changes and variations occured on Dilate, and yet they still managed to have a consistent, whole sound. Popping in Ellipse, I found myself bored as track after track provided nothing that hadn't been thoroughly explored by the group in previous outings. Indeed, it seems like they took the first track off Dilate and multiplied it six times, each track starting on a mellow riff and building to a loud, emotional finish. I'll give them that its their most consistent sounding recording to date, but I feel that it results in a stagnant, repetitive and unimaginative album. Very disappointing in light of brilliant and exciting works such as Lapsed or Dilate.",
"__label__2 Can one really be THAT good?: Probably yes, but it made me feel miles off!The format of the book, with different colours print to differentiate between the narrator and Marjorie Hinckley's words made it easy to read.

Such a cute lady!Personally, I found it slightly distancing that Pearce wrote about herself in the 3rd person. 1st person would have personalised the content more but that's a minor point.",

You can buy a book about a Rottweiler and find the same 90% ""standard"" section (expect a lot of write-up about NYLABONE and its allied products)in it, with only the 1st 10% section devoted to the breed.

"__label__1 A collosal disappointment: I have been listening to David Arkenstone's music since ""Valley in the Clouds"" was released, and I have to say that the last couple of albums have shown a sharp downturn in the creativity and originality which once hallmarked David's music. ""Caravan of Light"" is the worst sort of ""new age"" music; the musical structure is trite and the borrowings from the musics of other cultures is, at best, pretentious. Gone is the sense of openness and wonder which characterised ""Valley in the Clouds"" and ""Another Star in the Sky"" and adventurousness of ""In the Wake of the Wind"" and ""Quest of the Dream Warrior.""There is one small, beautiful gem, however. Track 3, ""The Jade Mountain,"" is an understated and lovely performance. It gives one a glimpse of David's true creative depths, which are otherwise sublimated by the bland, generic offerings of ""Caravan of Light."" For an introduction to the REAL David Arkenstone, I recommend the other albums noted in this review.",
"__label__1 Missing Maps: I rated this product very low since I had assummed that I was ordering a street finder for Europe and was very disappointed when I arrived in Switzerland, rented a car and tried to use the map function.

Unfortunately, I paid the data card and it would only identify locations such as airports, train stations, food places and fuel stations but it would not direct me to any of these locations.

"__label__1 Misleading artwork: The cover which shows Tunstall playing electric guitar leads one to think that the recording features some hot guitar. Unfortunately, it doesn't. In fact, even on the up beat opening track, there is no instrument break--a typical Tunstall song--unrealized potential. So, we now know that Tunstall can prance around and strum guitar but she can't PLAY guitar. However, all of the songs on the CD are decent if not exciting. It's disappointing that not more was done with them.At 39 minutes of music, this is not a generous offering and shows that Tunstall isn't a prolific songwriter. She has a fantastic voice and should have filled out the CD with cover songs. Also she needs a producer who has great musical ideas and can realize them with supporting musicians, lead guitar riffs and other rock 'n' roll ideas.",

"__label__1 RED SKY AT MORNING - READER TAKE WARNING!: Just like the month of March, this book started out like a lion and ended up like a lamb. Written before 9/11, there were places which made me cringe in light of that tragedy. But forget that the story line after the first two chapters was so far beyond fiction with a hundred submarines gaining entry into New York Harbor undetected and landing all these Chinese troops. Many of the characters proved to be very annoying and contributed nothing to the story. I wondered why some of them even existed in the book. The action was - for the most part - completely implausible. There were a few places that held the reader's interest, but only a few. Ideas were introduced and disappeared instead of being developed in the plot. I kept turning pages to see if it got better. It didn't. And after 400+ pages leading to a climax, the ending came very abruptly and ridiculously in less than 10 pages. Don't bother reading this one.",

I started to put it together, but I didn't get very far: the parts were so ill-fitting that I didn't have the physical strength to do it. I got my son to help me, and it was a real struggle for him to get it together, even though he is strong and very handy. At one point we thought we'd have to send it back because we couldn't get a rod fastened from one end to the other. Now it's together (although I'm concerned that it won't be sturdy, given the barely connecting parts), and it's nothing like the racer pictured. It's blue with yellow and red, instead of all red, it doesn't have decals, and the shape is different.

I am a fan of the more folksy IG songs and think that ""Let Me Go Easy"" is one of their best as is the live version of ""Gone Again"" available only on iTunes as far as I can tell.

The plot is reasonably engaging, and some of the characters are well done. The writing is at times good, but at other times sloppy. (Hamilton seems to have real problems with point of view at times.)Overall, though, it's far too long for what it is.

I have just read through the other reviews of this item and was amazed to see people are highly impressed by a pan that they must first grease before putting in the muffin batter.

"__label__2 Calamity goes to the Cotswolds: Crawl into the cozy of the Cotswalds with Agatha Raisin, who makes her debut as unorthodox heroine to the menopausal set. Taking a well earned early retirement to the village of Carsley, Agatha tries to adapt her presumptuous and pushy personality to the cozy and contentious community life. Aggressive Agatha is clueless in the deportment department, but determined to fit into her imagined idyllic retirement at any cost. And never imagines that the store bought quiche she enters into the village cooking contest will kill someone. Agatha's allure lies in her complete lack of tact and charm, her assertive aplomb, shrewd intellect, rude responses, and the little glimpses the reader is permitted of the human Agatha. The scenery is splendidly sketched, the cast of characters outrageous but somehow believable, and this middle aged mama's only complaint is that this book ends all too quickly - but hold on - this is a series, and more Agatha awaits.",

Most hardcore fans know that there are rare music videos for the songs Blue World and Sitting at the Wheel, and an even rarer, mostly unseen 1991 video for Say It With Love which is really sweet and SHOULD be included on this disc. All 5 of these videos are readily available on either the LEGEND OF A BAND DVD or the official Fan Club VHS that's been out for years. Someone missed the boat.

(Neither my mac nor my PCs can read the disks.) These misguided copy protection schemes (and the ""dual disk"" format is just that, a disguised copy-protection scheme) don't help anybody. It's easy enough to create a digital copy of the music using an SPDIF output from a high-end CD player, so it will not take long for pirated copies of the music to hit the net, but those of us who are happy to pay for the music, who actually want to be honest, are stuck with choosing between a high-fidelity version that won't work on the iPod, or the low-sound-quality version that Apple provides.

But when I actually had to use the PDA, the cover just got in the way too much, and became a big annoyance.The front cover for this case flips down. So when you want to access the PDA, you have two ways of holding it. One is with the cover dangling at the bottom of your device, banging into your palm. The other way is to fold the cover into the back, which is even worse since now the sharp inner edges are striking your palm, making using the PDA for a long time very uncomfortable if not unfeasible.The cutouts are also not very precise. Especially the mini usb connector. With the hinges in the way, I had to try very hard each time to push the cable in whenever I need to sync or recharge.Overall, I don't recommend this case.",

"__label__2 Sounds really good: I read through Amazon's reviews and on other sites and most people liked these speakers and they are higher quality than the bottom line type. They have a long warranty which says something about the quality - IMO. I'm using as stereo speakers with a 2 channel Onkyo receiver and an Onkyo CD player and also for TV and DVDs. For small speakers the sound is very good. They have a very wide frequency range and I compared with more expensive speakers and these had the same type of specs. I don't know if that actually means anything but it is a way to gauge. I used on the floor and now they are perched on 30"" stands. Either way sound good but I prefer the stands.Bottom line is if you are looking for an upgraded smaller speaker and don't want to spend a fortune these are the way to go.",

"__label__2 Slow start, but still a great book in the series: This is the 4th book in Flynn's series. If you can, you'll really want to read them in order. This one took quite a while to get going. The first 80 pages were little else but recapping the prior three books. I think some recap is fine, but this was way too much. From there, I thought it still had trouble getting traction. Finally, about the last 1/3 of the book took off and kept me page turning.I love the serial aspect of these novels, they flow nicely from one book to the next. I also like Flynn's mixture of actual history with his fictional world.So, far of the 4 books, the 1st and 2nd have been the best for action, the 3rd and 4th were much more focused on Washington DC rather than ""front line"" action.Appropriateness: This book contains a fair amount of language... a word or two every 10 pages. There are characters that are hurt and killed, but none are described graphically. Sexual situations are eluded to, but are not in this book.",
"__label__2 Difficult to read.. but well written.: This by far has to be one of the most difficult books ive attempted to read, and i to no extent mean the words more so the topics touched in this story. the only thing pushing me to finish it is hope that some sort of justice is served in the plot. The fact that a 40 year old deprives a 12 year old girl of her innocence will at most times in the book leave you in disgust and feeling disturbed. But credit be given where its due, the author is a genius and some would say a madman himself to be able to tell this story of a mad man. I do admire that with the touchy subjects that he wrote on he never used any sort of vulgar vocabulary to describe certain scenes. in my opinion its a mentally strenuous book to jump into because of the monster who is telling his story but the author hit it dead on, minus some parts which i think get very repetitive. take what you can from this story, which is hard to with a closed mind, and then move on.",

HOWEVER, after only a few uses we found the USB component to be a total waste of money. It breaks easily and then the presenter will not communicate with the PC.

Basically the story includes Cameron Diaz(who can't act if her life depended on it but still has fame and twenty million per movie) and Christina Applegate acting like fools in pursuit of some guy, convinced that he is the one. There are plenty of jokes and gags follow that supposed to be hilarious and aren't. Granted, some movies are stupid but funny.

I had the original vinyl back in the day and I loved it's quirky subject matter and classic 80s synth pop sound. Ned Liben (EBN) was the composer who sculpted the synth sound. I believe that he went on to work with Scritti Politti and, sadly, died in 1998 of a heart attack. I was a member of the Kurzweil K2000 User Group back then and one of the other members was close to him and his wife. He said that they had mastered a digital version of the album for release and it was just a matter of time before it became available. Well, I am glad to finally own it.The only reason that I didn't give this a 5-Star rating is because I really wish that it included the remixes of ""Bag Lady"" and ""AEIOU and Sometimes Y.""Enjoy and relive the memories...",

There are no songs on this cd which I would call a hit, no catchy melodies or memorable music. At least here two previous cds had at least 2 catchy tunes each, this one has none....Alanis seems to have attached like gangrene to the plight of angry women who have been hurt by cruel men.

I fell in love with Nelson DeMille as an author when I read his novel Plum Island in June. Since then, I read The General's Daughter as well as Word of Honor and both kept me reading until the wee hours of the morning. When I got to Spenceville, I was captivated with it at the beginning, but as the story went on, I found myself somewhat bored with the all too ""predictable"" plot. It was still a cute story but a little too ""feel-good"" ending for me. The characters are easy to identify with but it is hard to create any real ""attachement"" to them because of their ""whishy-washyness"". This is not to mean that I hated the book and do not recommend it to anyone but simply that if you too are a DeMille fan, you may not want to keep this one for last.

The introduction starts with Electric Eye just like they did on Rising In The East, on this dvd though the song sounds more like the studio version.

From a complete beginner, to someone with limited experience looking to improve the paddling experience, increase safety and basically have more fun, this video touches on all the little bits of information that are necessary, but that could take a lifetime to learn on ones own.

"__label__1 Okay Writing, Partially Reliable History: Irving Wallace liked to write what were, for his day, very racy -- and very profitable -- novels. So it's natural that he was attracted to the story of Ann Eliza Webb Dee Young Denning, the serially married onetime polygamous wife of Brigham Young, and that he tended to play up the same kinds of things that he emphasized in his more obviously fictional books.At least Ann Eliza comes across, in Wallace's recounting, as somewhat less perfect (and just a bit more believably real) than she does in her own expos√©/memoirs, which were based upon her profitable run as a somewhat titillating paid lecturer in Victorian America.Incidentally, the book was never ""banned"" in the Mormon Church, contrary to the deliciously sinister folklore passed on by the previous reviewer. The Mormon Church has no list of ""prohibited books.""",

This reel is not all that smooth and doesn't really cast that well for the price. It's probably comparable to most $30-50 reels at best in my mind. The rest of the price is for the name, which it seems has become the selling point of these reels over the actual quality. The screw that holds the bail on this reel broke in half and the reel is basically worthless to me now unless I can find a way to get the broken off part out and feel like spending $5-10 on a new screw from Penn.

"__label__1 Stay Away!: These have failed to reach my expectations.The product is much cheaper quality than I has expected for the price, I was afraid I would break them.I purchased these for my mother who has difficulty hearing certain voices and sounds on the TV.The sound quality was fair at best. And the reception was poor even when in direct sight of the transmitter.The ear bows are not adjustable resulting in a very poor fit of the device.The ear foam on the ear pieces was very flimsy causing the speaker to push through, possibly hurting your ear.Stay away from these.",

__label__1 Almost perfect: Very pleased with look and ease of assembly. The problem I had was getting a good paw print. I followed the directions but the molding stuck to the bottom of both my dogs paws. It is a real mess to get it out of their hair and made a very poor print. I eventually had to put plastic wrap over the molding first but the print is not very detailed. Will purchase a different kind of molding material for the paw moldings. The rest of the product was perfect and if molding came out would rate 5 stars.,

"__label__1 Poor: I don't know why I read this book, which I was aware was inspired by the famous movie, which in turn was inspired by a French novel written in 1959. Nevertheless, I can tell you why you shouldn't bother: It is most dull in its literalness and occasional spikes of melodrama.",
__label__2 It's all about Christy!: Hot Body DVD's are decent - like a less well-produced Playboy video. The good news is that they provide plenty of nudity and more often than not they have some very hot models. The perfect case in point is Christy Carrera. Her tan-lined body is exquisite and there is more than enough time spent showcasing her. This is soft core porn at best. Nothing explicit. But Christy makes it all worthwhile.,

Waste of Money!!!: I bought this roofing tool to re-roof my 1500 sq ft home...it did not work properly from the beginning...was prone to misfiring - such as firing when first attached to the compressor - it finally blew apart after a couple of weeks with the top hitting me in the face...this tool is DANGEROUS!!! Spend the extra bucks and get a name brand tool that will do the job without a risk of maiming it's user. This thing should be taken off the market!,

The only other good song on it was black math and even that wasnt brilliant. I think the way there is only a couple of instruments is different but it means that the songs sound similar and makes them sound like they aren't going newhere because there is nothing to build up to. It doesnt feel like there is ne energy going into the music and the lyrics are not v.meaningful. the whole album just lacks depth with the lyrics and the instruments.",

__label__1 Emergecny Use Only and Questionable: This is def not a great or a well made item. It is about the thickness of two one time use panchos but much larger. It will do in a pinch. Even at only $10.00 I was surprised that is was so thin; you can actually see right thru it. It is light weight and if the weather isn't bad/ not too hot nor too cold it would do. It doesn't have any sides so you could cut some large trash bags to cover the sides to keep rain out if need be. Just don't forget to pack some duck tape with it.Honestly; I'd rather rely on a poncho or tarp it would offer much better protection and is so much studier. Not bad for dire emergency but I would spend an extra $5 or $7 and get a good tarp I think you'll be much better protected.I don't recommend the product.,

It's THAT good. That landmark piece and other tasty goodies have been collected into McClanahan's MY VITA, with Ed providing some new bridging material describing his growth as a writer. It's a pity he's not a more widely recognized writer. If you dig Terry Southern, Charles Portis, or Hunter S. Thompson, you'll like Ed McClanahan. If you're of that bent, I'd snatch up this book before it falls out of print.",

The process is THE way to reduce the biggest risk outside of your startup's control: customer/market risk.It's a methodical, testable, measurable approach to what has historically been more of an art than a science: guessing what your customers want. More than that, it's accessible - the process is broken down into achievable chunks and can be adopted for almost any idea.This book is required reading for the founding team of our new startup, and every time we ""lose our way"" we go back to the hypotheses pegged to the wall. I can't recommend it highly enough.",

"__label__1 Inferior quality?: About a month ago, I purchased 2 of those ladybugs for my boys. The kids love them; the only problem is that they seem to be poorly made: I had gotten 2; neither one was very bright; then the green light went out in one, less than one month after having purchased them (apparently you can't replace the bulbs). I went through Amazon and the replacement came in last Tuesday (brighter than the first one); I returned the one with the broken light by mail today - and just now the new one (which was much brighter than the first two) wouldn't turn off nor change colors when pushing the buttoms on the wings. I then turned it off completely and now it won't turn back on at all.As stated above, the kids love them, but I don't want to have to continuously return them, so I am going to research other ones.",

Opening for groups at the 9:30 Club and taking the stage at the Black Cat, they've continued to increase their exposure- which eventually led me to them. I was happy when they put out the cd, because while I tend to enjoy less well-known bands, I dont want them to remain obscure for my benefit.The group is pretty damn good. So's their cd. In addition to their music, they've got a pretty funny vibe, as they poke fun in their songs and at their concerts. I'd suggest you put up the money for the cd, even if you're just curious about them.Oh, and the 5 stars is just cause they're from DC and I've seen them a ton of times. The cd is probably really a 4..",

"__label__2 Sky Dancers Fly: I have two daughters ages 4 and 6, I have read the other reviews about strings breaking and such. We had our sky dancer now for a year. At first my youngest did have trouble pulling the string, but once my oldest daughter and I showed her how to pull, she did not have any trouble. Camille flew wonderfully untill about a week ago when my cat developed a fetish for her wings. My suggestion to those parents thinking of buying one is this. My daughter is 4 and it took her a little while to understand how hard to pull this string. I don't recomend it for kids under 4. Also if you do have a cat you might want to put the doll up at night. I have given a 4 star rating on education for both hand eye coordination and control. I will be buying two more for christmas this year. Personally I think it's a great toy and a nice addition to a childs playthings.",

"__label__1 Not adequate for most home cleaning: I bought this steamer at a local store, and returned it after trying once. It is small, well-built and convenient to carry around. However, I found it to be inadequate for most household cleaning jobs. The heat was not enough and the pressure was not enough for cleaning bathrooms and kitchens. We are just 2 adults in our home and the house is fairly clean. Yet this tool doesn't have enough power to scrub and clean tiles or greasy spots that arise from everyday use.I ended up buying a canister steamer (1500 Watts) for around 100 dollars, and that works for us. I'm waiting for a powerful hand held steamer.",

I accidently left it in my pants pocket on the 2nd day I used it and it got washed, I was disappointed because it stop working but within 24 hours it dried out and was completely functional. I absolutely love this thing! I have bought 3 so far for family members and had a friend purchase one as well. It has truly motivated me to exercize more. The software that comes with it is great as well, it really helps you to keep track of your goals. The old saying is so true, ""if you can't measure it you can't manage it""!",

"__label__2 Ruthless on religion - open on the reality: This book is an excellent take on the absurdity of religion and its power to render a dull, mind-numbing, irrational, and uninspiring view of the universe. Even for an atheist and an aspiring physicist as me, the last chapter was truly interesting on the mystery of consciousness. The man is clear-thinking and smart as can be.",
__label__2 Fond memories: I was thrilled to find a CD copy of the vinyl album I bought in about 1964! I had bought another rendition of these Villa-Lobos pieces but it just didn't do it for me. De Los Angeles has a wonderful soprano and the Bachianas Brasilleiras need a great voice.,

"__label__1 Nothing spine-tingling about this book!: ""Spine-tingling"" appears on the front cover of this book. There wasn't a blessed thing that tingled about this book. There was absolutely NO mystery to uncover - everything was MOST predictable. This was a ""love"" story from beginning to end. I don't know about anyone else - but when I buy a ""mystery/thriller"" - I want some mystery and some thrills - other than those in the bedroom!!!

In my opinion, this is one of biggest band in the Prog. scene, compared whit giants like The flower kings , Transatlantic or Spock's Beard... the first time you hear teir music it can be difficult to ""understand"" it, but if you relax, kick your shoes off and taste some good wine you can really enjoy it and let your mind fly away, so you can visit places that you only can go in dreams... sit down and enjoy this beatifull music.",

"__label__2 Good product, but a rechargeable battery would have been nice: Got this after having two waterpics - the large canister w/hose AC driven one, and the portable type. The canister unit finally leaked too badly to use any more, and the portable has loose heads that prevent you from controling the spray effectively. This unit works great and the heads are stable so you can aim at a specific area or tooth. The only downside is it's consumption of batteries. You can buy rechargeables but then you need to pack a charger when you travel. The irrigator breaks down to a nice compact unit for packing.",
"__label__1 The Worst DJ: Music is at its best when it makes you feel something. Whether it makes you feel happy, sad, or like bobbing your head, music should be powerful in some way. Thom Yorke's CD and Radiohead seemed to forget that instruments make music, not computers. The only positive about this CD is Thom Yorke's voice, which is the only real instrument on the cd. This CD targets those who embrace apathy as if it were virtue. The CD as a whole is unmoving and emotionless. To see this in concert would look more like a man playing a computer game than actual music. Yorke used to play rock. What a shame. I gave up after 2 songs, but I'm sure there are plenty of you out there that will force yourselves to love it.",

Recently, other movies have come on the list and Sixth Sense is no longer on it.

And yet it's all handled with such cold, distant narration that it's impossible, as a reader, to care.Little surprise, then, that in a collection of twelve dramatic, explosion-filled issues, the most striking and memorable moment is a quiet scene halfway through in which a normally unreadable character collapses to his knees at the side of his giant dog and hugs him.It's among the few moments of real weakness, conflict or feeling in the entire ponderous volume.The artwork usually manages to be delicate and intimate, but even the powerful illustrations can't compensate for a lifeless script.The Inhumans ultimately serves as a long, rich, vivid description of nothing.",

This album has been heavily criticized for tampering with the Hendrix vision, but the song selection is better structured than the official release New Rays. It also does justice to the tracks they just threw onto South Saturn Delta without any thought of album cohesion.",

The first one was It's Hard To Be Hip Over Thirty And Other Tragedies Of Married Life. Each decade from that first one through this one has been a real companion. They make the perfect birthday gift for your women friends. Every woman relates to Judith Viorst's take on growing up and growing older.,

They are actually LIME GREEN, KHAKI, BLACK and not the olive green, khaki and dark brown shown. Because the bands are interchangeable it adds a certain amount of discomfort and an awkward, cheap look when worn. The only color that actually looks presentable with the green face is the lime green band and that is a stretch. Everything else seems to clash and doesn't blend. AVOID THIS ITEM.",
"__label__2 Reissue of Great 1983 Jazz-Blues Album: This CD reissue of Carrie Smith 1983 album ""Only You Can Do It"" is very rare, and unfortunately so. Subtitled ""A Tribute to Andre Franklin"", the album contains some very deep cuts of soul-jazz torch songs and ballads. A very enjoyable ride which sounds like its being played on a Quiet Storm radio station. Part of 3-volume series featuring the compositions of Gladys Shelley, also including ''My World Is You'' by Toni Arden and ''Doin' Things for Her'' by Vinnie Knight.Tracklisting1.

At the same time, the narrator begins teaching a promising Korean boy who shows signs of being a prodigy.

This story about a May/December love mismatch has potential, but the writer/director put way too many barriers in the way - besides the age difference there's also a language barrier and a different-career barrier (he's a budding violinist, she stays home and gardens). Plus there's the creepiness factor in that the two old ladies practically kept him prisoner, refusing to let the authorities know they'd found him, apparently unconcerned that someone somewhere might be worried about him. And why make the pretty stranger seem so evil when all she wanted was to take the fellow under her wing and help him fly? Why add the pretense of danger (Oh no! They might be German spies!) if you aren't going to do anything with it? This story couldn't really decide where it wanted to go so it meandered around for a while and ended up going nowhere.",

Although the film does boast Dominiqe Swain as one of the title characters, don't expect her to be the lead, she does play a big part, but not as big as Mia Kirshner and Meridith Monroe.Definately a film worth checking out if you like to have a surprise ending and like to act like Shurlock Holmes!",

We got to see every little step they took on TV and of course you wanted to root for them. But as much as I wanted to believe I had to face reality. They are an extreme wannabe clone of N'Sync. The album goes from super sappy pop to look at me I can be down with hip-hop/r*b. The music lacks production and the music lacks a concept. The mediocre single Liquid Dreams (have you heard the lyrics!?) and the song Girl are the best songs other than that you're looking at one of the most dissapointing albums.,

But even more ridiculous: the notion of a memoir in which the author ""made stuff up."" Why did she have to do that? Because the truth wasn't interesting enough? In truth, even this exaggerated memoir isn't interesting enough, in large part because Kyle Spencer is too young to be writing a memoir and because she takes herself way too seriously and thinks way too highly of herself. Her delusions of grandeur are embarrassing to read. (""I pictured myself leaping onto some carpeted auditorium stage, preparing to accept the third consecutive Pulitzer of my young career."") And her writing is just plain bad. (""I thanked Susan B. Anthony for getting the women's lib ball rolling."") Her attempts at self-depracation ring false. Get over yourself, Kyle!",

This book is well written and made me more interested in Pilates, enough so to go and buy another book on it. I bought the Pilates book by Brooke Siler which had a wonderful modified beginner Pilate moves. It was easier to understand and perform.

The other material on the album is interesting and for the most part, equally well-played and quite enjoyable though less remarkable and less commercial than the band's one big hit. Some songs are ballads, a few are quite bluesy, and others bristle with the unique sound that made 96 Tears a song worth listening to for more than 40 years. With 27 tracks on the CD it's a good sampling of what this band had to offer. I waited for years for this music to become available on CD and purchased this disc without hesitation once I discovered it. Don't sit ""down there, lookin up"", buy it now!",

Be prepared to read it and laugh - some of the essays actually caused tears of laughter to roll down my face. It's a really fun read. Yes, Sedaris continues to reign as the Master of the Essay, but Notaro's essays here are so much more enjoyable and a lot less grotesque than those in her first collection. I definitely plan on keeping an eye out for her other books!Of all the essays in the book, though, ""The Craft Toothbrush"" particularly stands out. Just thinking of it now STILL makes me laugh.

"__label__2 Very Insightful: Lester Thurow's ""Future of Capitalism"" is a VERY interesting book on globalization, and it is SO much more insightful than that silly ""Lexus and Olive Tree."" It does a great job of explaining the history and roles of the international / supranational organizations like WTO, World Bank, etc. Thurow is a highly respected liberal economist and he has a way of describing the ""third industrial revolution"" in a way that even old school economists can understand: It ain't about controlling or allocating resources anymore -- it's all about brainpower.",

Like the other one I own, this one also has loads and loads of power I don't even have it maxed and the output is amazing. If you aren't sure which amp to buy consider this one. It pushes two 10"" dual voice coil subwoofers easily. I just wish I had another one for my high channel output.",
"__label__1 If only I could give 0 stars...: Die Trying's debut LP is an extremely sad excuse for music-- every song sounds the same, and to make matters worse, DT sound like a carbon copy of Papa Roach. Yep, DT appear to be playing Papa Roach b-sides (I don't think I need to tell you how bad that is).Die Trying are for those of you who find Papa Roach's sound to be the best thing since sliced bread. If you have taste in music though, give this album a wide berth.",
"__label__2 Decent Messenger Bag: I happen to like this bag even though it's not what I was hoping for.I would like it better if it were more of a cloth type messenger, but the material is tough enough to carry some tools and the occasional knife or two.I have carried a laptop with it and it holds it quite nicely. There's not a lot of 'compartmenting' with the bag, but it does quite nicely for the quick throw over your shoulder and take it with you thing. I use it on a daily basis to carry some of my essentials and have even used it as a 'diaper bag' when taking my 18 month old out to the mall or the park.Excellent bag for the price.",

The plot of a little whale getting lost and asking various sea creatures for help finding his family is adorable. That said, I don't like this book much because the text is so painfully BAD - awkward and horrible rhyming, poor cadence, truly not fun to read aloud. I can't believe anyone would publish such awful writing!Also, the front pouch has never worked quite right.

Instead it would suck up water for a bit, then deposit it somewhere else in a puddle. I can't return it since the warranty has expired; I was the only one in the household using it, and I usually didn't have floor duty, so it didn't see all that much use. I cleaned all the parts I could get to; I suspect that somewhere along the suction route something has degraded or broken loose. Given the other reviews here of this nature, I don't really wish to spend more money getting it fixed, though, so back to mops I go!",

Even those who think they are excellent at spelling, can still take a look at some of the exercises. You might find out that there are still words you don't know how to write them correctly.And for those of you who still have a long way to go to master the English language, get a good grammar book and don't worry too much: Virginia Woolf, Hemingway, Emily Dickinson had similar problems, just to name a few personalities.",

It is full of grammatical, syntactical and spelling errors (for example, ""a lot"" is spelled as ""allot"" throughout the book). As far as the subject matter goes, it does an injustice to the word ""investing."" It would have been better to label it speculating or gambling. Even the late Al Frank, who based his stock buying on fundamental value, insisted on referring to the stock market as speculating. In any case, this book suffers from a classic case of confusing brains with a bull market. From 1995-2000, anyone could have ""succeeded"" in the stock market regardless of what market capitalization one decided to ""play."" Neither this book, nor most others on the subject, are particularly useful in knowing how best to ""invest"" in penny stocks over the long run.",

It took me a long time to slog through the dozens of stories contained in this volume.However the only positve aspect of the book are the commentaries before each story, giving a bit of background on each author and their placement in the history of 'hard-boiled' short fiction.

We have successfully used the book in programming the integral (or endochronic) hardening rule with the incremental theory of plasticity.

No. I only heard the music on CD. When watching this dancing, I feel as if I was watching ""Terminate 2"" with all figures spoke Shakespeare's language...The one star is for all the dancers.

"__label__1 Christian Book: C.A.Harday, a reviewer below, got a little carried away in her negative review of this book, but I agree with her basic criticism. This is a Christian book with Bible citations throughout. I stopped reading when I realized the author's obvious bias. When I'm looking for information on immune system health, I'm not looking for highly-biased presentations on religion. My bias isn't against Christianity per se, it's including Christianity without fully disclosing that personal bias nor making a connection between that personal bias and the supposed educational material of the book. The author needs to be more open and honest, or she needs to leave her personal religion out of her desire to ""educate"" about health. She quickly burned her credibility with me.A better book is 4 Weeks to Maximum Immunity: Disease-Proof Your Body by the editors of Prevention Magazine (2008)",

""Mars/Venus"" was one of the few CD's I can say that I can listen to and not skip at all!My favorites are ""weekend thing"" and ""after party"" but the whole CD is good. Some tracks aren't age appropriate for kids though! While no where near as raunchy as many rap albums of today or R & B singers as R. Kelly, Adina Howard or the legendary Millie Jackson, its probably best kept between you and your significant other.Beyond that, I consider this one of the better pieces of R & B/Hip Hop out there! Worth the price!",
"__label__1 Too much Tofu and Fat: I like the actual vegetable recipes, but many of the others incorporate tofu, which to me is horrible tasting. Some of the recipes are strange tasting such as the Spinach Quiche and the Tempeh Cabbage Casserole. I could barely eat either of these. I did love the Curried Saute. I also liked the Pasta Primavera. The hummus Dip was extremely salty (must be a misprint, 5 Tbsp of Tamari), could not eat it. Also, the Apple Loaf cake was really sweet, dense, and mushy (had to bake it forever) and very fattening. I have not tried all the recipes but it seems this book is too inconsistent. Another problem is, some of the ingredients are not easily found at your local grocery store. So you need to either order them online or schlepp to Whole Foods. In addition, these recipes have a lot of fat. Some recipes even have you deep fry in oil, which is very unhealthy. I think the Moosewood cookbooks are far better than this one. Sorry Morty. :(",
"__label__1 The author's intent was to display his error-free ego: Gen. Matthew Ridgeway is so full of himself that he cannot err. He is quick to point out his perfection by comparing himself to others of his calling, and although forced by history and fact to admit the other fine leaders of the 8th army did actually perform well in Korea, he is obviously reluctant to write of anything unless the sentence begins with ""I"". His book is garbage, and I'm ashamed to have served under him in that war.",

And don't think if your generic battery explodes you can sue somebody and win millions. These batteries are made in sweatshops in China, India and Korea, and I doubt you can find anybody to sue.

It was just so slow and I kept yelling at myself that something needed to happen! I didn't feel the main character solved anything especially when it seemed like Jackson was supposed to be some big thing to her. Then at the end I got totally bored and I was expecting to turn the page and at least have 10 or so more pages, not a couple sentences. It really caught me off guard how abruptly it ended. This is my first read from this particular author so maybe it was just this one book, but to me wasn't worth the try.",

"__label__2 Glimmers of hope in the worst of circumstances: It's a trademark of Danny Boyle's films to show humans clinging to hope even in the worst possible circumstances---just think of the ending of Trainspotting and 28 Days Later.Sunshine follows a similar pattern, with seven astronauts and scientists attempting to reignite a dying sun by means of a stellar bomb, thereby saving the Earth. That this could mean their own deaths is something that probably weighs on their minds as much as on the viewer's.The film will also put one in mind of Alien, with the confining space of the ship and the intimacy of a small group. There's even a nod to Silent Running, with the greenhouse/oxygen garden on board.The film might have benefited by the inclusion of some bits of backstory on these people and maybe some transmission from their families back on Earth. Overall, however, it is an intriguing story.",

I would strongly suggest looking through a copy to verify its usefullness to what you want to do before investing money in buying it.It sets up the machinery and provides examples of methods to determine distance from a linearly defined boundary of paramaterized point sets. If this is what you need to do, then it will indeed be a useful book.However wider claims of great usefullness in analyzing general performance of businesses, or any other entities characterized by incomplete information and random variation, need to be accepted cautiously. Hence my warning that it will be of very limited usefullness to the majority of analysts, and it would be well to verify that it addresses the problem one needs to solve before buying it.",

The quality of sound coming out of the headphone jack is worse that subpar, it barely qualifies as audible noise. There is so much static, I can hardly recognize the original sound. The fact that I would rather use my malfunctioning laptop audio jack should speak volumes about the poor quality of this product. Also, the minimum volume is way too high for easy listening, even if it were audible.Even though it is cheap, don't get it.

Also, the idea of the bulimic girl who is best friends and best enemies with this spoiled b*tch is just ludicrous. If I were you, and I had a second chance, I would avoid this book at all costs. Read The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants instead.",
"__label__2 Elegant, pretty, lovely dish - slicer scuffed: The cheese plate and the handle of the slicer are very nice. The blade was scuffed (the best word I can come up with). This tray was purchased to go with the Winterberry dinnerware set. This is not fine china, rather it is very nice stoneware that is sturdy yet appears very elegant because of the delicate decor. All pieces came intact and there were no flaws in any of the pieces, with the exception of this one blade. Every piece purchased was on sale, making it easier to buy extra pieces.",

The video is ,just like girls previous videos, nothing short of amazing.It's funny in its own ways and has some cool special effects that just blew my mind when I saw em. The skating is just incredible. Eric Koston closes the video with one of the gnarliest enders I have ever seen.The video features a great deal of styles with parts from Paul Rodriguez,Gino Ianucci, Eric Koston, and Rick Mcrank.(sp?) The chocolate section is awsome. Marc Johnson just rips it like no one has seen with his totally great style. I highly suggest if you are a fan of skateboarding you buy this video.Even the music is great. Check it out now.",

Quality of the sound however is quite good, but then again most radidios in this price range are worthy of quality speakers, such as the SR60's from BA that are in my car.

But as far as practicality goes - they're a total strikeout.- As the other poster said, there's no easy way to remove the ice cubes. As these trays are soft rubber, a flexible seal is created around each cube and flexing the tray doesn't eject them. You pretty much have to push each cube out through the back.- The top of the tray and cube walls are all the same height, this means filling all the pockets and loading the trays into the fridge without spilling is a challenge.- The trays are a non-slip surface, which means sliding them into the fridge also is annoying.Yes, these are all nit-picky points, but when it comes to something as simple and utilitarian as an ice cube tray, when someone gets it wrong, it's that much more noticeable.",

Besides this one I like, _Body & Soul_ and _Passing Fancy_. All are about what is to be Tenctonese and human, that's an interesting concept to me.The reporter in this one is a not very veiled Harlan Ellison, IMO, and I found that amusing. I also found a copy of _Black Like Me_ at a used bookstore after reading this. Telling _Black Like Me_ in a sf mode is interesting, well done, worth reading if you don't end up paying too much for it.",

The first one I purchased I had to return because the ""Quick Clamp"" mechanism was broken. Once I got a working one in use I was disappointed with its performance. Instead of cutting smoothly through wood it has a tendency to jump around, particularly in plywood. It isn't well built either.

"__label__1 Patterns In Imagination: Written during the height of the late Tech Bubble, it often seems to have more faith, in a secular way of course, in the imagined promises of technology in general and software in particular. The similes are compelling, and the parallels are intriguing, but there's always some nagging question on what it all means. None of the short-term predictions have come to pass, and the long-term predictions are more in the way of philosophical musings of the author. And, the almost child-like respect for computer simulations is questionable, particularly when presented without any supporting arguments or explanations. Not a book on technology as such, or anything really concrete or otherwise directly useful. Some of the points bring to mind the clashes between the Copenhagen and Gottingen schools when quantum mechanics was being conjured up. A good read for speculative background on artificial intelligence.",
"__label__1 Farfetched: The beginning of the book is a thriller, I can accept that, but when a 17 years old kid made a plan to find the person who want to kill her and everybody accept her as the bait is really farfetched.

The end, when everybody stays alive except the killer is just a way to end this fairy tale in the most pathetic way.",
"__label__2 18-inch Simulated Lambskin 'Spot Vermont Style' Chew Bone Toy w/ Squeaker.: My Labrador Retriever just LOVES this plush, over-sized bone-shaped toy, although it is NOT A CHEW TOY as my Lab has 'opened' it a couple of times over 6 mos. and we've had to sew it back closed. In spite of this, she LOVES the stuffed bone so much that the sewing occasionally is worth it. In terms of value, it is certainly worth <$10, but when you add 50%+ more for S&H it becomes borderline in terms of value. So I would give it 3-stars (OK product for $$) but my Lab would give it 5-paws up as it is one of her favorite toys to run and play with. But we've had to limit any tugging with it as the seams just do not hold up to too much strain. For tugging with a big dog, try 3 Knot Tug Rope Bone - White (24 inch) which has been very durable for tug play.",

"__label__1 Um ... not one of her best: Anne Stuart is usually a dab hand at romance writing, but here she (unusually) fails to transcend her maudlin genre. Oh dear, the old hackneyed memory-loss plot device. And am I really expected to believe that two supposedly non-stupid people madly in love with each other completely mis-read the other even through marriage? The heroine's character undergoes drastic change when she loses her memory (even though the book itself admits that amnesia does not bring on personality change) which is never satisfactorily explained. The plot is not only predictable, it is too incredible to work for me. Sure, romance is never realistic (by definition; life is not romantic) - but good romantic writing should bear at least a passing resemblance to reality.",

When I do boil water and try to pour it out, it runs back and makes a mess on my kitchen counter or on the table. If I leave the lever down over the spout while it boils, I have to use a potholder to lift it to be able to pour the water out.

It's not for everyone though.If you just want to put your workout DVD in the player and follow the instructor's commands, then this DVD is definately not for you.However, if you are prepared to put effort into learning routines then you will probably enjoy it. The start of the DVD she goes through each dance combination step by step. Basically you can just keep rewinding and playing back until you get it. When doing the main workout she doesn't call out the next step or instruction - therefore you need to have spend the time learning the routines.The routines do take some time to learn, but with repetitions you will get them down pat.

With hooks so smart, if I were a fish I wouldn't mind losing my life to hooks like that. I would snap on. I would take the bait. They could reel me in.Axes is starker, and more Stockhausen, which is always popular with modern minds, not always mine. It's what John Cale's Paris 1919 should have sounded like, and was so disapointing and boring because it didn't. And it's a lot like that final, two-album leap that Talk Talk made when they transcended everything, when they abandoned pop for good and went free. I hope Electrelane stick around though.",

Last time I used it, I filled with 200 degree F coffee and at 6:00 am, I didn't use it until 2 pm and when I poured it out it was room temp maybe slightly warm.So used as a large mug, used immediately (or within a few hours) after filling, it's not bad.EDIT (end of Dec 2009):I just threw it out.

Well, it didn't even do that, it was bad folks, baaad. And movies have to be pretty bad for me to shut them down. Will Smith was not convincing in his character as he also was not convincing in his roles in ""Independence Day"" and ""Men in Black"". He looks much too young for these characters and shows not an once of maturity in his lines and actions. If he acted more mature, it could help offset his youthful looks.

The obsession that the old sensai from Karate Kid part 1 and the millionaire had with Daniel's title was disturbing. I also doubt that he went to Vietnam because he looked like he was in his late 20's. They should have switched roles...the milloinaire could pass for the karate kid and Ralph Macchio (with a little makeup) could have passed for a middle aged Vietnam vet.The plot is predictable as well...if you're paying attention, you'll have an idea of what's going to happen.

I've bought some CDs at the local record store and was very disappointed before I wised up and started looking through the reviews here at Amazon for some better material. This looks not like a Western collection, but like an actual Chinese CD. The liner notes have a rather melancholy feel to them, and this is reflected in some of the music showcased here -- piece number 4, Parting and Yang Guan, is particularly moving. The instruments evoke deep emotions; one in particular (I don't know what it is called, but it sounds like a violin) literally does not ""play"" but rather ""sings"" these sweet, expressive, minor-keyed melodies.

This collection really deserve the title ""Masterpieces"". I only wish I knew where to find other works of this high quality.",

"__label__1 the epitome of mediocrity: This book is very poor. I give it a poor rating because the solution manuals that compliment this book are very mediocre. The solution manual that came with the book (It came bundled with the text at my college bookstore) seems as though it was hastily put together. Some answers are wrong, have typos, or even lacking altogether. The solution manual only covers chapters 1-12. The remaining chapters are covered in another manual...that's where the above problems are thrown into plain view. In the second solution manual, some answers don't match, are missing, or wrong. For example, chapter 13 has two sections that are flipped around, which shows the haste in bringing out this book. I have nothing good to say about these texts. When Calculus 3 is over this semester, I have 660+ pages worth of TP...that's the only way I feel the purchased can be justified.",
"__label__2 Hope and staying true: How can you maintain hope in the midst of environmental degradation, waste, and human callousness? While not ground breaking, this is a thoughtful, beautifully written book about life's values and staying true to nature. I loved the chapter on fidelity. The author's relationship with his teenaged son while camping and hiking is both humorous and touching. A very good read!",

"__label__1 Good writing, poor story: Not sure what's with all the rave reviews. I picked up this book thinking it would be a mystery set in mountain country, and to some extent it is. Box has a good writing style, but I did't care for the story. Children being threatened and stalked (or neglected and beaten), harmless animals exterminated, to name a few points I didn't care for. It certainly seems as if Box knows his outdoors; i'd just like to read a story that's a little more straightforward mystery and less rambling mess.",

__label__1 No friend of mine: I have very rarely given this bad of a review. I normally give at least 3 stars just for writing. I was shocked ms. Delinsky put this dribble out. She has written some fine books this is not one. The use of the F word and sex was just gross. The fact that a best friend could have sex with her best friends husband and by the end they are all friends again. Then the story goes on that the injured wife can understand why the husband had sex with her friend and neighbor. Come on what world does that happen in? I finished this book because it was on CD and I had a long drive otherwise I would have thrown it across the room. Why anyone gave this book 5 stars is beyond me. If you want to read trash this is perfect.,

The only complaint I have is I have used it only one time and some of the porcelain is coming off and that means rust. I guess 4 stars is pretty liberal for the rib rack because of the porcelain issue but it is the only one that i have tried that i can cook 4 whole racks of spare ribs and not have to cut some of the ribs in half,
"__label__2 Very thoughtful: I have never really had any opportunity to interact with individuals afflicted with this unusual and often debilitating ailment. Mark Haddon's real-life experience with autistic children allowed him to craft this masterpiece by providing the perspective of a young autistic teenager's mind. Christopher's why of thinking - and consequently, his actions - make logical sense, but because he lacks a normal person's ability to make intuitive connections or understand the unspoken, Christopher has to rely on the imperfect set of rules he's learned about human behavior. Haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that Christopher can't.This is a book that I highly recommend to everybody - it is not only an interesting read, but also a great learning experience. Another great book (actually a series of books) that I liked for its educational values is ""Why Some Cats are Rascals, Book 1"".",
"__label__1 because it was BAD: the acting was terrible (the only decent actor in the cast was Michael Ironside). the plot line was NOT true to the Bible (excuse me, isn't the tribulation supposed to last 7 years?) it wasn't even true to the Bible Code (what was all this gunk about 'the last line of code'? all the bible code does is pull from what's already in the Bible) if you want to read a good story about this subject, i highly recommend the LEFT BEHIND series (most of the plot and characters from the Omega Code seem to be copied from it anyway)",
"__label__2 5 Stars, most definitely: Great CD. Practically every song on this is good and enjoyable to listen to. If you like Depeche Mode, you will most definitely like this.

"__label__1 disappointing: I saw the ""Picasso"" play in Laguna Beach, and was disappointed. I'm a Steve Martin fan, and a fan of the theater. But, frankly, this seemed like a play that was written by a TV gag man (Martin wrote the old ""Smothers Brothers"" show.) It was very very two-dimensional, considering its intellectual pretentions. Frankly, I think Martin is a first rate comedic actor, and stand-up comedy writer and performer. But the only screenplay he wrote that was good was ROXANNE, and that was good because he just updated--and did a twist on--""Cyrano De Bergerac."" He is NOT good at long narrative fiction. He's good--often brilliant-- at small bytes (which is why PURE DRIVEL is good). He should stick to what he does best.",

__label__1 OK but could be much better written: The information contains in the book makes it a pretty good primer on SIP. The organization of the book and its content is very good. The language and ways in which the author explains certain things are confusing. I think the author should be able to do a much better job in explaining things. I often find myself having to re-read certain explainations twice and much carefully when I feel I shouldn't have to -- the topics are not complicated but not well explained. Someone like Doug Comer or Richard Stevens would probably be able to make it a much easier read.,

Even getting to the point to saying, ""waste the bitch"" as signal to the way one was getting killed. Toooo descriptive that gets boring. In general this could have been a kick ass book, taking out the stupidity and inaction for the main character, making him more ferocious, not talking too much non sense, and by keeping a pace well stated. By the way, I gave away the book, with the book-marker in it, marking my give up point...",

This book is perfect for you if you have been playing classical guitar regularly and for some time now -If you are trying to grow in your ability past the beginner stage and the early intermediate stage.This book is something you should get if you have some time to commit to the guitar on a regular basis because the warm-up exercises and the various left/right hand exercises take time. Just doing these exercises will take an hour of your playing time.If you already have a repertoire and you want to become more technically proficient then this book is perfect. the exercises really do work. If you have the time to commit to this book your playing will improve dramatically. It will help you identify and improve technical points that you are weak at.,
"__label__2 A very important movie for those who shop at Wal-Mart!: If you wonder how Wal-Mart got so successful, then this film is a great example. My only problem with the film was the exclusion of it's founder, Sam Walton.

On the opnener ""Talkin about JC"" (John Coltrane of course)Young sets the groove, and then Green starts to groove, for every 12 bar chorus he digs deeper into the groove. I am also very fond of ""Luny Tune"". It gives a kick when Green takes off right after the lead, his guitar is singing, and his playing is flawless and totally relaxed. I always felt that Jones and Green goes very well together, and that is something that Jones confirms in the biography about Green, which is by the way highly recommended to all ""Green fans"".(REDISCOVERING THE FORGOTTEN GENIUS OF JAZZ GUITAR, by Sharony Andrews Green, MIller Freeman Books)",

It worked great during all that time and then all of a sudden it stopped producing any real froth. It started just producing some bubbles that quickly dissipated, leaving the milk as flat as before. Changing batteries doesn't fix it; it appears that it simply doesn't have the RPM it used to have and can't do the job anymore.Having gone back and reading more of the negative reviews, it seems this is a common thing. Some get their Aerolatte in this state from the get-go and for some it works for a while and then slows down like it did for us. It's such a shame because it worked really well while it lasted. If it was half the price, I might consider buying a new one, but at this price it's just not worth it. I will look for an alternative.",

""Black Hawk Down"" had good production and good depictions of war in general but it was lacking in scripting and acting.The script just was not all that good and the movie failed to have much of a plot. It just seems that this movie focused to much on just one fragment of the plot and never seemed to move on to something different. In general not much really went on in this movie it was just revolving around the same thing over and over. The acting was not all that great either. I was not impressed with Josh Hartnett in ""Pearl Harbor"" and I definitely was not impressed with him in ""Black Hawk Down"". This movie failed to give me the enjoyment and excitement other great war movies has like ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Platoon"", and ""The Patriot."" This could have been a great movie but the plot and script was generally just to boring to accomplish that.",

Through the eyes of the main character, the reader is quick to learn the lessons of life and death with the war as the instructor.

Well, almost two years later, it started to get scratchy lines and now I cannot read the text. Amazon will sell me a refurbished original for $99, but no discount on Kindle 2 or the DX. . . . I think hardware should last longer than just about two years, especially given the cost. Since it is a fault of their design and product, I think they should reward customers who willingly tried the first edition (especially when it cost so much) and at least provide a discount on the new technology. I am disappointed and going to investigate other readers and things like the iTouch. . . maybe they will not break so quickly.",

And thats not all, she finds out that the wizards are trying to take over all the magic in the Dragon world. You have to read this great fantasy/fiction book to find out what happends to Kazul and Princess Cimorene.

I managed to get it used, but as far as I'm concerned [money] was still too much to pay given the potential of the subject. I agree with some of the user reviews I've read about editing. Kaplan suffers from Stephen-King-itis, i.e., made a name for himself as a guru and apparently believes he's above editing and each word is golden. I agree with another review about it being a good visual title on the shelf, it's just too bad it lacks specific detail and workable code samples so you can be sure he actually knows what he's talking about. (Yes, he does often know what he's talking about, but if you weren't familiar with his reputation, it wouldn't be proven by this book.)",

The language is straightforth and simple without losing any of its meaning, which has lent to its popularity among nursing students performing clinical rotations in the unit.

In fact, more violence would've ruined the intensity of the film as a whole. And thank god for the few moments of comic relief&#65533;some of the only chances a viewer gets to release some of the pent up tension carried throughout the film.

I didn't have any of that with this product.I wasn't sure what size to pick so I might have gone a bit larger than I needed but it worked out fine.

It never leaks AND, after falling down a flight of 13 steps onto a hard tile floor, it didn't leak, break, or even dent - the handle and all remained as new! It's easy to clean with a drop of detergent inside, close and shake well, rinse and let dry (it is not meant to ever be washed in a dishwasher). The capacity is large enough for more than four good 8 ounce cups of hot or cold beverage in a day. Highly recommended and great value and longevity for the cost.",
"__label__2 IMHO not for children: I found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad. But when it turned to what I guess is an opiate trip, it got downright creepy. Gave me nightmares.I'd heard of it forever and I'm glad I read it. But I would not read it again.",
"__label__1 black stuff in water: I have had two of these so far. The first one leaked when water was filled all the way to the top. Therefore I was only able to fill it up about half way. Soon the lid also broke so that each time I poured water into a cup, the lid would slide off. The second one I got was fine. But every now and then, the black carbon particles would end up in the filtered water. Sometimes the water would taste as though it had not been filtered at all. I rely on this product because it is the only realistic way for me to get filtered water here in my college dorm. I really wish there was another company that made a better product.",
"__label__1 Nature at its worst: OMG I really want to give this minus 5 rating. Sound quality is not bad but what they are recording are so annoying!!! Who needs to hear a cat meowing (the way it wants to eat NOW) and puppy crying. What a torture! It would be a cool sound collection for other purposes (if you can think of any). Definitely try the sound sample before buying it. But for relaxation, I'd recommend some of those echo of nature or summer rain, etc. instead.",
"__label__1 Do NOT buy blu-ray set for regular DVD!: Okay, first I don't have blu-ray. I refuse to go to yet ANOTHER video format. But I wanted a DVD of the new transfer of A&C MEET FRANKY with the correct logos (the last DVD had Realart Titles). So I bought this set as I knew the blu-ray was correct. So what did Universal do for the DVD disc? They stuck in the old Comedy Legends disc from 2000. A transfer from the dupe 35mm fine grain with plenty of white dirt and a bad audio ""fix"" in the main title (a trumpet riff repeats annoyingly). My question is, why BOTHER to put two discs in this set if one of them isn't going to be of the new transfer? Phooey. Don't get me wrong - I'm sure the blu-ray disc is great and if that's what you're after I can recommend it blindly. But if you want the latest transfer on DVD, it ain't here.",

"__label__1 Silly, that's all -- just silly: I can't quite get up the energy to write more than a few lines about _Meg_, truly one of the silliest books I've ever read. What this is, is _Jaws_, except that Allen invented a bigger, badder shark. That he plays whack-a-mole with science, beating it into submission whenever it doesn't fit his purposes, is the least of the book's problems. As a spin-off that's spun so thin it's transparent, the _Meg_ series is apparently Alten's retirement plan. And good for him. We can't all sell fireworks by the side of the road",
"__label__2 Epic theatre: This is a very enjoyable production. Although some people may not like some of the actions on the stage, I think they're necessary because the Salzburg stage is simply so large! Besides, they're mostly very appropriate. Jerry Hadley and Catherin Malfitano are excellent leads and they've got excellent support from Gwyneth Jones, Cornelius Smith and Wilbur Pauley. This is the kind of epic theatre envisaged by Brecht and Weill. The picture and sound qualites are very good.",
"__label__1 Cold Heaven Left Me Cold: I've never read any of Brian Moore's work previously and honestly plan not to read him again. This book left me hanging in suspense and unsatisfied eventually. The ending was a huge disappointment, Marie's dilemma extremely repetitive and qutie honestly I just didn't get it. Perhaps not being a Catholic made this novel a muddled mass of seemingly unrelated incidents to me. I did not understand the accident and near-death of Marie's husband in relationship to her visions. It left me cold and wanting to return to what I consider better works.",

"__label__2 Great Bouncy Seat: This bouncy seat has worked well for us. I like to snug, enclosed feel that the canopy provides, as well as the 4 location where toys can be attached. The music modes are pleasant and not too loud. I like the fact that the music turns off automatically after awhile, otherwise I would forget and run through allot of batteries. The vibration mode, however, keeps running until you turn it off and is a great soother when the baby is fussy. One note of caution is that the wire frame legs extend out a bit from the seat itself. This makes the seat very stable, but also makes it easy to hit your toes on it. Or maybe it's just me. All-in-all, we love this bouncy seat.",

My baby's head goes to side and seems to be uncomfortable. I'm actually going to return it for a full size swing.",

Pilates, on apparatus he designed. I use these videos to compliment the lessons I take with certified instructors. I am constantly learning corrections to my form and movements as I can clearly observe the exercises and listen to the insightful and in-depth instructions. I recommend these videos for beginning students to those becoming instructors. The talented certified instructors who demonstrate these exercises are an inspiration to watch! I look foward to learning these exercises as my physical ability continually improves and expands into more advanced forms. These videos teach you exactly what Pilates is and how to perform the method safely and correctly.",

"__label__1 Heartlight, a book review: Heartlight is a science fantasy book by T.A. Barron. The book is about a 7th grade girl named Kate who has moved into a new town. She has trouble making friends, so she spends most of her time with her unusually preoccupied astrophyisist grandfather. When he suffers a heart attack and mysteriously disappears, Kate is forced to embark on a quest to save the sun and another star. I disliked the book because it did not seem very scientific. Also, I would have liked a greater variety of conflicts for Kate. The most well written characters in the book were the giant butterflies, Morpheus and Orpheus. A better science fantasy read with a similar theme would be ""A Wrinkle in Time"" by Madeleine L'Engle.",
"__label__1 Turbo-Driven brush -- what a joke!: I used this model twice and promptly returned it. The ""turbo-driven"" brush works only by the suction of the vacuum; it has no additional motor. This means that if the suction is ever less than perfect, the brush stops turning and is useless. Actually it's worse than useless because the non-turning brush then blocks the airflow and hampers suction. So I would not recommend this model.",
"__label__1 NOT WORTH IT!!!: I admit it, this is a good collection of Brubeck's works through the years, but it is not worth it. Just buy every album seperately. You'll be better off that way. This album is just a scam so someone can make a few bucks off it!!",

__label__2 I am going to add Little Black Book to my book of fav movies: This movie was the instight to relationships everyone needs to have. This book was as true as it gets. Brittney Murphy and Ron Livingston were wonderful. Holly Hunters character was great too but you wanted to smack her in the end. This is a movie about a girl who's life was being lived by example of her mothers. She ends up in love with a wonderful guy and he ends up leaving on a business trip. With the coxing of her peers she decides to check into his past relationships and starts to nose around in his palm pilot for insight to his past relationships. Its funny how she comes to a relaziation about her relationships and relationships of others. This movie could not be more true to fact. Loved every minute of it. Sound track was wonderful and made the movie. Three cheers for little black book. Watch this movie today and may you find the perfect relationship.,

"__label__2 History of the J.G.Brill Company: A superb book. Very well researched and complete. More than just the story of a family and the successful business enterprise they built, it brings to life an earlier era. Debra Brill has a marvelous writing style and I hope she continues to write for our enjoyment. Much less dry and more enjoyable to read than most histories. Highly recommended.",

"__label__1 One good, one bad: I was a disappointed that as another reviewer had mentioned one of the cups leaked internally after one drop the first day. It's just too much of a hassle to return. The other one appears to be working so good so far. I sent my hubby out to store to buy add'l cups and he came back with the same brand - so I guess we'll try again. I also must note that they were only 7.49 at Target. But I guess we pay for the convience of shopping at home. With all that said - my son really liked the cup.",
"__label__1 Not what I expected: What I wanted was a modern translation of the Qur'an that was easy to read and understand. What I got was a translation full of ""thees and thous"" that reads from the back to the front, more than a little disconcerting to a non-Muslim. My intention was to attempt to understand the Muslim religion as it truly is, without any politically-correct ""spin"" put on the text. The fact is, to get the true meaning, one must be able to read the text in the original language, Arabic. My quest for understanding will unfortunately wind up in my rather large ""unfinished book"" pile.",
"__label__2 A thoughtful faith: Lauren Winner, a frequent writer for Christianity Today and professor at Duke Divinity School, opens her story to us so that we might have a glimpse of what it means to wrestle honestly with both the Jewish and Christian faith traditions in the postmodern world. I'm deeply impressed with her honesty and tenacity in holding these elements of her life in creative tension: she loves the way Judaism shaped her love for text and ritual and singlemindedness toward God, but she is unafraid to explore why she became drawn to Jesus and Christian theology. I recommend this memoir for those who are interested in understanding a personal account of what draws a person to an intellectually rigorous faith amidst a culture of skepticism.",
"__label__2 This is truly a page turner!: I loved this book, it fully held my attention and I wanted the outcome to be good for the characters. However, I must say that I did think that at some points the characters were more like caricatures. Granted this may be intentional on the part of the author, but I didn't care for that aspect of the book. The heroine, Dolores is not really a standard heroine as at some points you feel that she really is her own worst enemy, but it is because of this that the author successfully conveys her humanity to the reader. She is a poor broken soul looking for a peaceful life, whatever she considers to be enough just to keep her balanced. Finally, all I want to say is, read this book, it is a swift read because you DO want to find out what the eventual outcome will be!!!!",
"__label__1 Review forTrue game of death: This movie is terrible. It does not star Bruce Lee and is not directed by Robert Clouse, as advertised by amazon. The only scenes with Bruce are some third rate snipets from Return of the dragon that have nothing to do with The true game of death movie. The best way to describe this movie is that they tried to remake The game of death In which Bruce Lee does actually appear for those few fight scenes that he is in. Acting was terrible! sound, Terrible! Fighting sequences, terrible! Over all this movie was terrible and I do not reccomend that anyone buy this or rent it for that matter.",
"__label__2 What a voice!: This is probably my favorite album by Randy Travis, and definately a must-have for anyone who enjoys Randy's music. He gets you with EVERY song -- with warmth, humor and that gorgeous deep voice! It's like he's right there, singing to you, telling you his story. The fun ""If It Ain't One Thing, It's Another"" probably describes your life perfectly! The beautiful ""Long On Lonely, Short On Pride"", ""I Wish It Would Rain"" (""so she won't see what she's doin' to me"") and ""Future Mister Me"" and ""Price to Pay"" are rich with emotion, humility, and honesty, -- they are all soooooo good! Need upbeat and twangy Randy? -- check out ""Would I"" (he had to be dancing when he recorded this one!) You will not be disappointed!",

Her fiance is not feeling well and she is trying to help him plus take care of a couple of orphans and solve her cases. Her character is one of warmth, kindness, generosity and strength.

Our OCR software is 99 percent accurate if the book is in good condition. However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos.

I gave it a rating of one because there are some bright spots but they are very few and far in between.,
"__label__2 Her Best Book Yet: Linda Hall has done it again! This book is sure to be a best seller! Katheryn's Secret is a weaving of suspence and intrigue. Right when you think you're on the right trail, she throws in another twist. Anyone who loves a great mystery will love this book. It's a tale about family secrets, the effects of a legalistic, religeous upbringing and how God can work through the misguided mistakes of family. It's about love, lost love and love rekindled. Linda shows us--without being preachy--the difference of being religeous and having the love of God in our hearts, where we learn to love others. Her characters are real and well developed, as is the plot. By the time you finish this story, you may find that you identified with one or two of her characters and hopefully--learn from their mistakes.",

He refers to the ""naieve VB programmer"" who understands little about the interface between the COM object and Windows.

Art, to be honest, is pretty horrible -- yeah, I know McFarlane's supposed to be la artist supremo numero uno, or something, but his Lizard looks like a toad, all of his regular humans (especially Mary Jane) look more like cereal box mascots than real people, and his rendition of Spidey, at least in my opinion, is just average. Above all else, I get the idea that McFarlane just really doesn't like Spider-Man as a character. Skip it -- get some of Straczynski's brilliant run on the book.

The relationship starts in high school & is severed for the first time when the two are involved in a car accident. Years later they meet in Africa, where they begin a short lived affair. They meet again at a writer's conference, over 25 years later. Ultimately, Thomas learns that there are consequences to his decisions, missed opportunities, time lost. The story was a disappointment, too slow paced, the only excitement - the denouement at the end. The story labors over Thomas' feelings, but there is little elaboration on Linda's feelings - her personality seems flat, almost indifferent. The story reads like a bleak rainy day.",

"__label__1 Saw has become Blunt: After seeing the first Saw I was so looking forward to this one. But I had my worries. I loved the first one, but unfortunatly this doesnt come to the standards of the original. I have noticed how people have compared the original Saw to the film Cube with its similarities. Saw 2 not only has similarites, but looks almost exactly like it. People locked in a house full of traps, entering the first room to get to the second. Sure this film is a lot better than Cube, but it could have done a lot better than this. Throughout the film when something big is about to happen, it just comes across different death scenes like slasher films. Saw is NOT a slasher film. Saw 2, however, follows in its footsteps, finding an easy way out. Its like they just want to get this film over with. Saw 2 still has a neat ending but also added something a little silly to it. Not half as good as the ending to the original. Overall, Saw 2 isnt rubbish. It just seems a little pointless.",

Remember, Satan is the father of lies, and many might think reading a book about excorcism written by a jesuit priest is harmless and safe, when in fact it is not.

With those two novels MacDonald burst forth on the paperback original market in 1950, after his apprenticeship in the pulp magazines, as a fully developed talent, fully as great a writer from the get-go as he ever would be. Unfortunately, ""Wine of the Dreamers"", while it succeeds for its ideas, is a dud with respect to execution.

These conversations ramble on and on, over and over. The heavy New England dialect is frustrating to interpret.

Who else writes like that? Murray in his prime maybe. This is a book about history, and baseball history second.",
"__label__1 I give up.: While I never thought the Wheel of Time series was anything utterly extraordinary, the first three or so volumes were a fairly good read. But now it's become clear that Jordan is just treading water: Path of Daggers is a bloated, boring, virtually plot-free attempt to keep the series from heading towards any kind of conclusion. This is the last one I'm reading, period.",
"__label__1 2nd one not so good: This is the second Apex stove I have purchased. The 1st one lasted 15 years before the steel braided hose started leaking at the pump. Since it was cheaper to buy a new unit than replace the hose I purchased the Apex2. The 2 did not fair as well as the first one. The unit started leaking form the steel braided hose in the same place as the 1st, after 5 uses in a year. I do like the stove it has a good burn and I like the adjust-ability of the unit. The flame can be set on full blast or a very low simmer. The base can be adjsuted to be level on just about any surface and I never had to replace a generator on the 1st Apex and it got a lot of use. If it was not for the hose going bad so soon I would give this unit top billing, even with it's heavy weight. I may try to repair the 2, but I can't trust it anymore.",
"__label__2 Boogie on Foghat...Boogie on!: Too many folks think nothing good ever happened to Foghat after Stone Blue but they are terribly mistaken as Boogie Motel, with Foghat exploring some of their musical roots is definitely one of their most under rated original lineup releases.

"__label__1 NOT SO GOOD OVER TIME: UPDATED NOV 22 2009DOWN TO ONLY 1 STAR - PIECE OF JUNK .... BUT THE BATTERY LIFE SEEMS FINE. It just has so little suction and the wet pad idea is just a dirty mess maker. I use it for light (I mean really light) dust-busting, but it is not shaped or designed for just that, so I can't even use it as an effective dust-buster except for a few spots around the house.DO NOT RECOMMEND.I was pleased with the quick light cleaning at first. However over time, it really turned out to be much less useful than I first thought.The suction is terrible and the cleaning pads are a mess. Taking off the dirty ones, washing and replacing makes the whole thing problematic.The pads are attached with velcro and stretch and wear poorly when washed. Thus they do not fit that well once used and washed several times, and the velcro has it's own typical loss of adhesion after constant use.THUMBS DOWN in the long run.",
__label__1 Waste of Money Do not buy.: After many years of using Norton Antivirus I figured I couldn't go wrong. I was already using ZoneAlarm's shareware firewall and I decided that Norton would be the real deal. What a mistake. This program simply is too difficult to understand to find out whether it indeed could work. It seems far less flexible than programs that are given away for free.If you want an idea of what others think of this piece of garbage check out ebay. You can buy earlier versions for less than the cost of shipping! One of their competitors will give you $10 rebate for the disc. It's more than you will get from anyone else.

And they will ignore your attempts to get the charges reversed.,

Manson is an extremely romantic character and a pop culture icon and while that explains the interest it does not explain this film.

If you are incredibly curious and fanatical you will pursue regardless of any review, but if you want a good documentary, try elsewhere.",

I have never read one of John Grisham's books before, and I have heard that this was definitely not one of his best.

"__label__1 Vo5 charged hair metal: Theres no denying Jon Bon Jovi has an incredible vocal range and Richie Sambora, unlike many 80's guitarists can really wail when he wants to. The first half of this album fares much better then the second half. Theres arena rock gems like ""Let it Rock"", ""You give love a bad name"" and ""Livin on a Prayer"". ""Wanted:Dead or Alive"" is worth listening to if simply to hear Sambora's sick guitar intro. Unfortunately the second half of the album collapses under its own hair gel. Theres a couple more rockers but mostly ballads so sappy they make Sammy Hagar look like a die hard cynic. IT will make you grateful Kurt Cobain came along and destroyed this kind of spandex and Vo5 charged poodle hair metal. In any case the album does make you wonder how much you got to fork over for those girls in the album jacket to wash youre car.",

I have read other reviews about how the movie is dated and ""politically incorrect"", c'mon people this movie was made decades ago, and for it's time, it was and is dynamite, I will always remember the scene at the end where, the maid has literally died of a broken heart,'cause her daughter has rejected her. There is a funeral procession led by beautiful white horses, and Mahalia Jackson is singing at the Funeral , and the Maid's daughter running behind the funeral procession, screaming ""Mama, I'm sorry!"".

Whoever thinks MadChild doesn't listen to bars should consider that maybe MadChild doesn't give a [damn] and considers that his style. I love Bad Dreams as well as every one of my Swollen CD's.

If you enjoy contemporary 'British detective' stories don't waste your time on this book. The characters are cardboard, the dialog(ue) stilted and unbelievable - the plot so tedious that your eyes glaze over. I suggest you head over to one of the 'Bill Slider' tales to see how this type of modern detective story should be written.It is not the waste of money I object to, so much as the hassle of getting the dings out of the wall caused by my throwing this book across the room.[If you have read Jasper fforde then the title 'Caversham Heights' says it all - if you haven't, then a quick 'search' will explain all.]",

They do work with my other units, but I could have bought the yellow ones for half the price from another seller.",

I don't even think the acting was, it was just not a good plot.",
"__label__1 One of the worst: This is the one of the worst interviews I have ever seen Charlie Rose conduct. He after all the years of following the issue shows a total misunderstanding of the Middle Eastern reality. He accepts without question the whole one- sided and misleading idea of the 'occupation'. He shows no real awareness of Palestinian Arabs true positions. When he asks wide-eyedly about the intentions of Hamas- and Fayyad evades- he does not follow up. My goodness. Hamas night and day proclaims its goal, purpose is to destroy Israel. The fact is Fayyad's Palestinian Authority in its media presentations demonizes Israel. Charlie Rose shows no awareness of this. He does not question Fayyad on the whole internal Palestinian chaos, its continual efforts at Terror.What a disappointment from someone usually so informed and fair in his interviews- conversations.",

I enjoy the tour that I went on with this book, places good and bad, just thinking about the food was really great for my mind-eye. Since I live in New Orleans Mardi Gras is something that I know about,the carnival season in the book was great. The way that self-hate and hate of family was display in the book would give other a good food for thought. There were so many characters in this book that it was just fun to read and see how their life would bend in the story and who would feel the effect of their bending. The cover of the book is what the reason that I pick up this book because the male in the far back call to you. Again this was a great read and a fun book to try to figure out, plus I couldn't go to the first chapter and then the last chapter without missing somethings.",

"__label__2 Excellent knife that feels ""right"" in your hands!: I picked-up a 10"" Wushtof Chef (the one on this page) and a 6"" Chef when I was in Germany and I love them. The 10"" is large enough that you can cut large items and also has a wider blade that helps with ""proper"" chopping technique for those of us who are not ""professionals"". Of course, the wider blade also allows you to scoop-up a good amount of ingredients for transfer to where-ever you need them.Even for being such a large blade, the knife is light, balanced and easy to handle. I anticipate that these knives will last me a lifetime if properly cared for (for example, I always use the honing rod before use which will help prevent the need for sharpening). I recommend these knives to everyone I know who enjoys cooking even the least bit and I feel it's better to have a few well-selected quality knives than one of those ""sets"" of cheapies (most of which are filled with blade styles you'll never use anyway).",

"__label__1 A remarkable collection of nonsense: I have rarely found so much nonsense compressed between the covers of a book. This a collection of unwarranted, groundless assertions, irresponsible generalizations and shameless one-upmanship. The success of the book in the 60's is proof of the intellectual despair that marked that decade, attempting to get out of the Vietnam Tragedy throug false gurus and other unsubstantiated claims to objectivity. The few pearls are buried under such a mountain of bull that it is not worth the effor to search for them. Mr. McLuhan pretends to know about everything, and shows he knows absout nothing, with the possible exception of English literature. And even there, his judgments are rarely valid and most of the time intellectually irresponsible. This is not a serious book.

The most talented actor in the film, Steve Buscemi had a comparitively small roll. You tend to want to compare it to Michael Keaton's 'Clean and Sober', but in reality there is no comparison which is disappointing. All in all a very forgetable film.

Just Actors and Directors patting each other on the back.If you want to see a film that explores this type of content with a little more realism and understanding of a complex subject, purchase Clean & Sober.",

It is mood-altering. The documentary side of it features facts (and a little bit of poetry) from a few narrators, including Neil Armstrong. I'm no expert on tornadoes, so I can't judge the accuracy of the facts. The footage of tornadoes dates back all the way to 1928.The most captivating thing about it, though, is that for long stretches of the program, the narrator is silent, with only the ambient music and occasionally sounds from the tornadoes creating the atmosphere to match these stunning images. Like listening to Tangerine Dream, this film is spellbinding enough to put me in a trance.",

While it is set in 1920's Illinois, this book resonates perhaps 50 years into the future, and into the past. Alas, I fear that it may resonate very faintly in these ""post-modern"" times. Still, if your life is rooted in that Golden-Age of small-town, heartland America, you will recognise these scenes, these characters, these feelings. Bradbury is a writer, a poet actually, of the heart and of feelings. Indeed, before I read him I didn't have the understanding or the patience to read poetry. Afterwards I did. He opened me up to subtle things.When I see people critisizing his style as rambling or flowery, I can see that they just don't get it.

Jackson), their clothes and hair(slip dresses, blue eye shadow, twin sets, bouffy hair). This book is going to be out of date in about ten seconds from now.

"__label__1 I wanted to read about Black Dahlia but I got All these Unrelated Stories....: Well, I was really really undecided whether to get the fictional version of Black Dahlia or this book. Then I figured, I wanted to read about facts. So, I chose this book instead but it was a disappointment. Not much about Black Dahlia but all these other stories about Bugsy, etc. It was interesting to find out about the LAPD, corruptions, and the newspaper companies at that time but all I really wanted was the story about Black Dahlia. So there, I thought Mr. Wolfe was all over the place and not really concentrating on the main subject matter of this book....",

"__label__1 Very dissappointed: I have heard so much about Anne Perry that I had to read one of her books. After I renewed it from the Library for the second time (14 days) and found myself still not finished, I concluded, it was not keeping my interest and was very slow moving. I went to the last few pages, and felt I got most of the story. Only then,do you find out where the documents are and the whole event is very simple. Regarding the world events surrounding WWI, better to go to a history book or true historic novel. If it sequals well, there may be hope. But I would not recommend the book. Better to spend an hour watching a murder story on Law and Order for a fun evening.",

There are no pads for the shin and the knee pads are to loose and bulky. The hip pads should be right over my hip bone and a smaller pad for the knee and front/side of the femur. I had another pair of padded long underwear for motocross from VTop, that are no longer available. I've long since worn those out and needed a new pair for downhill mountain bike rides. I wish they would use less bulky hard plastic pads for the hip, femur and shin, with thiner, less bulky pads for the knees. I did keep these underwear and will use them for hockey.",

"__label__1 Eat Pray Love - Pass: In short pass. I watched this drivel with my mother over the holidays thinking it would be a wonderful chic flick with beautiful travel cinematography. It was terribly boring, no great travel shots and a waste of our time. Neither my mother nor myself are fans of Julia Roberts but thought perhaps this movie might be fine because of the travel. I only paid $1 from the kiosk rental but still not worth it. Save your money and time - even if on sale. I agree with another reviewer the companions in Italy were the most interesting part of the movie but never really developed the characters. The reason for the main character's up and leaving husband - the hopping in/out of bed from husband to flaky actor to sensual Javier Bardem. I could not emphathize with the character. Too self absorbed and she brought the unhappiness upon herself. For a similar chic flick I'd rather watch Under the Tuscan Sun which had a nice ensemble of characters that were allowed to develop; not Eat Pray Love.",
"__label__1 Barbershop Claptrap: This book is nonsense. It makes sense to me that the world's most powerful have influence on world events--even undue influence. It makes sense to me that some hope to create a new world order in which economic ties erode and eventually override political ones. While I think Curtis Dall may have many truthful things to say, his style is so full of inuendo, half truth, and guilt by association that I could hardly recommend this book as a credilble source for one working on a Ph.D. in History. I do not essentially disagree with Dall--I just think his approach is that of a amatuer who is not fully there mentally--and for that reason his potentially good book falls short--rediculously short.He reminds me of the claptrap one used to hear in the old Barbershops of the 50's and before. Belly-scratching bloviating. This tome belongs on the shelf with the UFO books.",

"__label__1 Dull and Depressing: In the latter part of the book, Marak wakens and has trouble remembering which passage through the desert he is on. That aptly sums up the plight of the reader. I forced myself to finish, because I kept thinking something would actually HAPPEN. The happenings in the book, however, given the context of endless desert travel, seemed contrived: dust storms (of course - what else can happen in the desert?); childbirth; Tain's potshot; running out of water/food; desert predators; they all seemed inserted just because something needed to happen. Compare, for example, to The Key to Rebecca, where the trek across the desert was brutal, but it was only a lead-in to the story, not the story itself. I also found the book depressing. The ""victory"" at the end was not an uplifting triumph, it was a non-event, framed by an apparent huge loss of life (although we never find out how many perished). I did find the hermaphroditic tower of the cover art interesting, though.",

Well, I'm sorry to report that this camera, for the amount I paid, does not live up to its reputation. Low light pics are the noisiest I've ever seen and being I will be taking most of my pics at gigs and concerts, this camera will not do it for me. I tried every setting including all manual settings but who wants to fiddle around with manual controls if you're trying to capture a candid shot?

"__label__2 Tempest review: Very true to the original play and without any of the fancy special effects that some directors like to rely on. Excellent actors. The characterization of Ariel was exceptionally good. Costumes tended to be a bit exaggerated, but true to the time period fashions. The director took quite a bit of liberty in the first scene between Stefano, Trinculo, and Caliban, lending it a lot of semi-awkward sexual innuendo that tends to either make the audience laugh their heads off or squirm in their seats. Other than that, there is little to nothing of the play's content that might offend an audience.",

I found it impossible, however, to approve of a film that implies that the weight of the African swallow is not well-known. King Arthur, being an all-round Kingly sort of fellow, would never have been so wantonly ignorant of ornithology, and to imply this was so is a gross insult. I also found it grossly offensive to limbless knights, grenade-throwing monks, and other minorities. I was watching with a three-headed ogre friend, and she literally burst into tears at the stereotyped protrayal of her race. (Three heads, that was a lot of tears to clean up.) Only utter lunatics would find this movie funny. That includes everybody I've ever known, by the way, except for a grumpy Scoutmaster and my dour auntie Prue.",

I found it frustrating as games could not be replayed to learn the layout and there were way too many tiles to have a good feel of hidden tiles.

All in all it's a great deal but I have two complaints: I would have preferred a brush attachment on the little hose end but the real disappointment is the non retractable cord. It has to be wound up to store then unwound to use every time and that's a time gobbling design flaw.",

(How embarrassing!) On the second run through the house, we never needed to empty it a single time. Talk about suction!! Even our high traffic areas are fluffy again!Better yet, it was easier to push than my old vacuum. The center of gravity on the Dyson is lower than your average upright, so it's not constantly tipping over the way my old one did. The extra long cord allowed me to reach the entire house from one central outlet. Assembly was quick and easy, and I LOVE that most of the tubing is removable and washable. Way to go Dyson!",

There are many excerpts from his writing and letters which give the reader a greater sense of Jefferson's broad intellect and love of nature as it relates to his gardens. I was hoping to find a list of flowers native to Virginia cultivated by Jefferson but, while the origins of many of the flowers are indicated, there is no separate list of the native plants as I had hoped.",
"__label__1 Avoid...save your time, save your money: Nearly ten years ago Jeanette Winterson wrote a brilliant book-""The Passion"". Ever since, she's completely lost the plot. Is the language beautiful? Yes, but after you've read her other books it fails to dazzle as much. This one is about 3 nameless characters on a train, running away from their miserable existences and you'll probably need to read it twice to figure out what the whole thing's about. Basically i think she's trying to say : The modern world is rubbish, and art (supposedly this book counts) ought to rule. All very tiresome, a bit naive, and exceedingly pretentious. Go read something by Calvino, Kundera or Marquez instead .Whatever you do, don't buy this one. If you must, borrow it from the library.",

"__label__1 Combination of smooth jazz/schmaltz: The CD features primarily smooth jazz or schmaltzy arrangements. Not too much actually grips the listener or is passionate. To overcompensate for this, Dianne tends to oversing shrilly on a few numbers, hitting high notes for the sake of hitting high notes, rather than for the sake of the song. There are much better albums of hers out there. As another reviewer notes, there are a couple of good cuts. My favorite is where she swings the blues with Joe Williams in a big band setting on ""Deed I Do"", which is a lot of fun. But when I want to listen to Dianne, I'll be reaching for one of the jazzier or more soulful albums she has recorded.",
__label__2 Just what I needed at the office: I wanted to cut down on the amount of coffee I drank and realized one of the main reasons why I top-off is because it cooled down.

It is supposed to stop if encounters a clog, but occasionally we would find it slipping the pulleys against a clogged rake. Eventually both of them suffered a failure of a gear in the ""transmission"".I don't think this is the worst machine in the world and maybe if you pay enough attention to it, it will last longer. But ours needed to be taken apart too much, the bags and liners are an added cost and for the price it is not worth it. I will not buy any rake style automatic box again.",
__label__2 TomTom Go 720: I bought this 720 to replace a 720 that kept falling off the dash board of my truck. The last fall broke the plug where the power cord connects. I love the 720 and was lost without it so I bought a new one. The only problem I have is the suction cup on the mount. It seems like it only lasts for about a year. Of course I leave it in the car with the unit attached all of the time and I have a disc on the dash which the mount connects to. I did have an issue with the maps when I first hooked the unit to my PC. I made the seller aware of the issue and they stayed in touch until the problem was resolved. TomTom actually resolved the issue for me with very little trouble. I actually think my issue was my fault due to already having a 720 set up on my PC. But within a week or two I had my 720 up and running with no further issues. I would recommend the 720 to anyone.,

You'll scratch your head and ask, ""Did I just experience the finest human voice in all the world?"" Then you'll look in the mirror and notice a goofy ear-to-ear smile on your face that tells everything.So let's just get it out in the open: Hayley Westenra has the most heavenly, ravishing, soothing and uplifting voice in the universe and ""Pure"" will almost make you forget about Norah, Barbra and Celine.As obscure as she is in the USA today, word of mouth about ""Pure"" will eventually elevate Hayley to a dominant place among popular music artists.

"__label__2 Rankin & Bass Do King Kong: Just as Rankin & Bass had tackled Tolkien before Jackson did, they also did a King Kong movie. Once again we have a remote island where Kong lives. He also meets a blonde beauty and falls in love. But this version has more. We have an evil villain who has constructed a giant robot Kong to aid him in his schemes. But the villain, Dr. Hu, discovers that the real Kong would work even better.Now add some gorilla mind control, suitmation, miniature sets, and titanic battles between giants and you get an unforgettable epic (even if you want to forget it). The result is a film that fits somewhere between the original and a Godzilla film. Visually speaking the film is pure Godzilla-style and a credit to the Kaiju films of its day. While not as polished as some modern Kaiju films no Kaiju library should be without one. The dubbed dialogue actually adds to some of the fun as the villain gloats and compares the two Kongs.

"__label__2 Nice big digital clock with date. Great for senior adults: this is a very visible digital clock. I got it for my aging parents to put in their bedroom and they can see it from all angles. Having the date is definitly a plus for them. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't have some kind of a stand. It is narrow and unless you hang it or lean it against the wall, it is easy to knock over. With a stand, it easily gets 5 stars.",

This book ultimately takes fundamental ideas which are simple to understand and by the time you are finished you are overwhelmed by the simplicity of both the arguments and the arguer.My issue is not with the text but with the delivery. One of the most difficult tasks is to try to make statistics, facts, and concepts such as discussed in this text interesting.This book neither compels the reader to continue to research this subject, nor come up with their own ideas. It is what it is, a text which provides facts but little by the way of enjoyment.",

"__label__2 The Great Mock Orange soars to new musical heights: This is definitely a 5 star disc. Mock Orange has been my favorite band since I first heard 9s and 6s for their creativity/originality and musical talent. This album is in every way better than both 9s and 6s and The Record Play, and it is not hard to say that. I would have to give the first two discs 4 stars. Mind is not Brain is by far the most mature and well rounded of the three, their best to date and the best rock out there today. It's just plain cutting edge. The sound is new and original, the songs are more complete and the singing is right on. The Great Mock Orange will finally get the respect they deserve for this masterpiece of music. If there is another band with this sound, I would love to know. It's time for emo to get funky.I am in love with this cd, get it and tell all your friends to get it.",

The entire plot was ridiculous, and the ending, well, that was beyond silly. In addition, I just didn't get into any of the characters - Starling was too much of a patsy, Lecter was boring, and Verger, although he did have the makings of a good character, was just too over the top. Either Harris felt pressured to write a sequel that he really didn't want to write, or he was just darn lucky on his first two attempts.

This is not really a book for those looking for practical guidance on the transmission or distribution pricing of electricity. Also the book isn't good value for money.

The only negative about this product is that the adhesive is not holding one of the ends down. I let it set for over 8 hours, so that's not the problem. It's only in one section, though.

The solar motor chugs a weight around to the top of a circle and then allows it to drop to bottom of the circle, moving a small glass prism around and around quickly, striking three chimes. Well, when the weight drops there is clunking sound followed by a muted melodic of the chimes. Clunk, chimes, Cluck, chimes. Is it Frankenstein protesting his innocence?

Normally I would not continue to buy an item with such low quality, but I'm addicted to a nice quiet house now, so I keep coming back. Expect about a 9-month product life, and that's if you NEVER forget and leave the unit on overnight!",
"__label__2 great recording, then, now, and always: I don't remember the ,70s; I wasn't even alive then. Gram Parsons was dead before I was born, but, thanks to this recording, I've had the opportunity to listen to the golden voice that is still vibrant with life. This is an outstanding country-rock recording, and it's great to have (it bears repeated listenings very well). I would have never have stumbled on it, but my uncle, knowing my musical tastes (which include Dwight Yoakam, Lucinda Williams, and Bob Dylan), guessed that I would like it, and he was right. Now, I'm guessing that if you like great music, you'll love this album too. Buy it today, and help keep the tradition alive!",
"__label__2 MAGNIFICANT!: ""Vector Prime"" is the first book in the STAR WARS novels I've read. I picked it up at a book store, planning only to read it until the books I ordered arrived, but I got into the story so much I've gotten addicted to the series, I've ordered two more. ""Vector Prime"" is wonderfully written and has action after action. It has fallowed up on the characters very well and has given us the chance to witness, possiblely the down fall of our beloved characters. The introduction of the Yuuzhan Vong gives our heros a worthy villan. Plus, the writer adds something to the story that will change the lives of our hero's forever.If you haven't read this book, read it, if you have read this book, read it again!",
"__label__2 A definite bargain: The recordings are obviously not the greatest on the market - Tennstedt certainly can't match Karajan's version of the 5th. The 2nd is a little disappointing, I agree - this is my favourite of the lot, and Gilbert Kaplan's recording of this with the LSO is fairly earth-shattering. Notwithstanding, for the amazing price, this set is an excellent buy, and the playing is of a sufficiently high standard to please all but the most critical listeners. Unless you want to spend another $100, take this opportunity.",
"__label__1 Pure Barre is a rip off.: For the price of the DVD I expected more than one 20 minute work out. Also, the instructor is wearing a black loose fitting outfit and the video is such that you can't see what you are supposed to do and she doesn't describe it well enough. The DVD is a waste of money! It is possible that the Barre technique is good for shaping and toning, but you won't get it from this DVD.",
"__label__2 A brilliant effort: Mike Peters, ex-lead singer of the Welsh group the Alarm, has delivered a superb solo album. Though many Americans don't realize it's his third since his departure from the Alarm in 1991, listeners will love his work. Expect to see additional works from Peters as he teams with ex-cult guitarist Billy Duffy to form Coloursound. This new project expects to release an album in early 1999.",

"__label__1 Deceptive ad!: I just received this, and it comes w/out a battery. No mention of this in the specs, and the battery is an extra $40-60! Also, it is very light duty for such a tool. The instructions show an example of sharpening a knife..... the existence of a tool like this implies that it would be capable of cutting through a steel rod...!?Ripoff!",
"__label__1 Always Read Reviews That Give ONE Star First To Get The Truth: [...] This young girl is having fun and she's got the personality that kids can relate to, that's it!She is NOT terribly talented and is doing NOTHING new. She's just imitating the big girls (who also are limited in the talent department) and children don't know any better. But, let them have their fun -- it's better than seeing them playing with guns or bullying other kids.",
"__label__2 Keeping the Trend Going: Tooth and Nail and its associate labels continue to make great leaps in the quality and variety of acts they are signing. The X series of CDs and DVDs could be considered those labels' greatest hits from the last recording year, with a few dips into earlier seasons. Most of the tracks on this DVD are more Christian inspired rock than outright praise and worship; but there are some real gems of His wisdom throughout. Some of the tracks are making headway on the secular scene like Thousand Foot Krutch's ""Move"" that was used on ESPN. Overall a tight effort. If you are already into Christian rock/hard-rock/hip-hop/metal, this is a must-add to your collection. If you want a good sample of where Christian rock is going these days, this will give you a chance to find bands that suit your taste. In short, this DVD rocks. Buy it.",
"__label__2 Good Bike Rack: I bought this bike rack a couple weeks ago. It came fast and appeared easy to install. The one thing I did not notice when I ordered is that the maximum height is 9'6"". My garage is unfortunately about 10' making this unusable until I made it to Home Depot and got two concrete blocks that are about 4"" thick each for ~$2. Now the stand is up (very easy to install) and holding two bikes. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that I wouldn't want to bump the stand too hard with the bikes on it, it's a little shaky!Overall I recommend for a cheap way to store bikes and save some space.",
"__label__1 Come See The Worst Album In The History Of Music...: Whoever should read this beware. This is the worst album I have ever had the displeasure of attempting to listen too. The songs are bad, the words are bad and Don Johnson is just plain bad. Don Johnson should take a hint from this album and just quit his job and go live on a desert island. Why do you think MTV and VH1 have declared they will never show this video again. If your name is Don Johnson and you are reading this I mean no harm, in fact I'm trying to prevent this album from taking millions of innocent lives. Say no to ""Heartbeat,"" just say no.",
"__label__2 Lyle is in his own orbit: There is not a second of disappointment on this album. Are we in Texas or Chicago? The String work on"" Can't Resist It"" is unreal! Where has Francine Reed (Wild Women Don't Get The Blues) been all my life. Lot of work behind these cuts, and it's worth every minute of it for us listeners. Lyle's only category is excellence!",
__label__1 Sadly Not Well Made.: I bought this because i thought it would be great for my 18month old. Once i received it i started to play a song using the book it came with. Right away i noticed some of the keys would get stuck down which made it hard to properly play a song. Also if you tap on a key over and over it will not recognize that and make a sound such as other pianos would do. For this price i think it can be constructed way better. I returned it.It is very pretty though.,

"__label__1 Misleading!: For the mostpart, this is not a collection of Grace Slick's solo works, it's yet another reissue of stuff that's already out there.

"__label__1 Crossroads of Twilight: Robert Jordan's last book has helped me in two areas. The first was to improve my speed reading; I only had to read every 10th page to understand the plot. Second was the security that I would be saving money in the future, this is the last time I will be duped into buying another one of his books. It's hard to understand how an author could start out so interesting and end up so boring. I wonder if money has anything to do with it?",
"__label__2 Complex and meditative beauty: This CD is one of the jewels in my piano music collection. I guess if I had to compare it to something I'd have to say it is vaguely similar to Debussy's more dreamish works for piano, with a milligram of jazz added. Sorabji's music style sounds very improvisational, yet it makes coherent sense overall. In my opinion this is the best piece that Sorabji ever wrote, don't expect something epic like Beethoven's fifth symphony though. Here is just the song of the simple, meditative wanderings from a glass half-full of red wine, sitting on top of a moonlit steinway, Le Jardin Parfume is a deep midnight contemplation.",

"__label__1 Review after 80 hours.: I played this game for about 80 hours, then quit completely. The reason for this is because the game is so boring in the beginning, it makes you want to tear up the disk and throw it at the creators.Ok so I'll be fair and give you some pros...and of course cons.Pros------------------1.Nice graphis with high res, and fair battle engine.2.Rewarding game after you play for about 200-300+ hours.3.Fast load.Cons------------------1.If you want to play this game with a friend, your friend has to go in-game and spend a considerable abount of gil (money) on something called a 'World Pass'. This allows you to make your character on their server, but can only be used once.2.Very slow traveling and leveling.3.Expensive fee.4.Need a friend in real life before you start this game to help you.As you can see in my review, the cons overshadow the pros.",

"__label__1 Buy the *other* Oxo can opener: After briefly playing with this unit at a friend's kicthen I went to a local retailer to buy one, only to find they were out of it- so I bout the other, less futuristic looking Oxo can opener. As it turns out, I lucked out.My Oxo is still going strong after two years; it's the best hand can opener I've used. This model, though, has since been discarded by my friend. It works great for a few weeks, but then the plastic bits start to wear, and the locking mechanism starts to stick, and the user starts to swear.The idea for the lock was a good one- that seniors and others with limited hand strength could lock it on, using both hands if ncessary, and then concentrate on turning the knob. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way. The lock becomes more of an annoyance than a help, the handle isn't terribly comfortable, and ... well, it's just not a terribly good design.Oxo makes a lot of lovely products, so I suppose you can't fault them for the occasional turkey.",
"__label__2 Great house for any insect: This is the habitat only, (as stated, you must send in the coupon for the insect(s) plus shipping. If you are ordering this for the praying mantis, make sure you order by April, so you can get the egg cases sent to you before they are out of stock). This is well made and easy enough for a 5 year old to get in and out of to take care of the praying mantis. Its nice because it has a zipper at the top for smaller opening. It has handles to hang as well. The screen is small enough to allow oxygen in and keeps the insects inside nicely. Great for educational learning about nature and other creatures. This can be used over and over again for other purposes as well.",
"__label__2 Wow!: Well I must say that Jude Deveraux's books are some of my favorites. I love her time travel books and will always by them. This one is confusing at times but after a while you get into the swing of things. I cried and laughed at this book. I stayed up all night reading it, it was worth being so tired the next day I couldn't keep my eyes open. Buy this book and keep it to read again and again.",

"__label__2 Outdated sure, but still relevant: This book, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now. Hence the four stars instead of five.Given that, the first part of the book is crammed with a precis or summary of Flusser's recommendations that he has used several hundred pages to expound in his other books ('Clothes And The Man', 'Dressing The Man') and makes the book worth the (used) book price.I do not understand others who warn against this book because they think it is not objective enough! This is a book written by Flusser so of course you will get his subjective view. Had it been written by a committee of tailors, well then, I would expect a more balanced view, but it is not.

At first I thought she must be a Brit because her sentences are long and rambling and frankly almost impossible in some cases to interpret. They run together and I have to just wade through page by page. Very interesting subject matter but the book is much more like a text book of the history of China than a book on Stilwell. I understand the background history is of utmost importance but she jumps back and forth and many times I have to go back to find dates for the time she is talking about. Not sure I will be able to make it though this book. I've been to China 6 times, Taiwan two times and have a historical background but it hasn't helped much with this book.Fascinating subject matter however. Just seems like someone should have proof read better and re-arranged a lot of her sentences that are a paragraph long and future present or some such thing!",
"__label__2 Just take care of it.: When you use this gun correctly, and take care of it, it will work just great. Even the best ones need occasional cleaning and lubricating, and this is no exception. I've found that a small amount of basic oil (WD-40) works great, when used carefully. If you don't mistreat this thing, It'll last forever. I've been using this one for almost a year now, on a daily basis, in huge yard wars. It mean that this thing has literally shot tens of thousands of times, and it's just as reliable as it was when I first purchased it. Take it from an expert; this is a very good budget gun. It's reliable, powerful, pretty accurate, and will never jam, for as long as you take good care of it.Also, I want to note that when people complain about jamming or accuracy, it's generally due to low quality of the plastic ammo. If you use cheap ammo, any airsoft gun will stop being good. Get some good ammo, and this gun will perform admirably. And it's less than 20 bucks.",

I'd keep telling myself.. one more chapter... one more chapter... o but wait.. one more chapter!!! i highly recommend it.

I had already gotten Anthems..., IX Equilibrium, and In The Nightside Eclipse, so I knew I had to get this. I got it, put it in my CD player, and I was absolutely blown away by it. When ""The Eruption"" first came on, I was amazed. The guitar playing is excellent. The lyrics, the vocals, everything is brilliant. The lyrics really deserve an applause. They are brilliant. Not many other bands write this damn good. I am glad I bought this. It has opened my eyes to a bigger world of black metal, unlike Cradle Of Crap. Thanks guys for giving us this.

I learned to cook pasta from my husband's Italian mother and grandmother and I thought I was doing well, but this book has refined and simplified my pasta dishes. The book is easy to read and easy to use with step-by-step directions. After making one of the tomato based sauces, my husband said it was the best he'd ever had! There are recipes for every type of pasta, too, using seafood (my favorite), herbs and oils, and cheese. Fresh pasta, store bought, how to cook it...whether you've been cooking pasta all your life or just learning how this book is perfect. The pictures alone make it worth while. I, also, purchased the author's Ultimate Bread book and love it as much as this one.",

"__label__1 Bottom of the barrel: Incredibly bad 1950's fantasy/horror movie about an abominable snowman on the loose in Los Angeles. Everything about this one--writing, acting, production values--is strictly grade Z. It is beyond belief that a major studio like Paramount was associated in any way with this thing. What were they thinking of? Ed Wood would have been ashamed to have his name associated with it.",

What a great find! I am still so excited about this! My kids love it and me and my little newborn were invited to a dinner party they put on this evening using this set!They have so much room to play and the area where the dishes can be placed in the middle is their favorite. It was so fun watching my son take the pretend spout and clean the sink that was ""really dirty"" lol. My kiddos are 3 year old boy girl twins and this has to be one of their all time favorite toys!",
__label__2 Another Winner: I am a huge fan of MHC. I have to say this is one of her best. Not too many characters to keep track of. She has a tendency to do that. Which is a weakness of hers.This was very suspenseful. I had a hard time putting it down. No lags in this story. I love the fact that she gets her point across without the profanity that some authors think they have to have.I will keep her on my must read list.,

"__label__1 No new information and poorly compiled: This is an introduction into the Kennedy family, but beyond that the book is not very helpful. The author Jay David Andrews drew most of his material from other popular books (such as All Too Human by Edward Klein) and articles about the Kennedy family. Andrews does not divulge deeply into the Kennedy family, the myths, truths, or provide any new insight or information to make this book worth reading. As another reviewer stated, this book has a tabloid quality about it that detracts from the quality of the book. A reader will learn more about the Kennedy's by reading other news magazine reports and other books about the subject.",

You need to get past the constant referal to needs not being met and focus on the needs your spouse has and work to meet them. The work book that goes with the book was the real valuable tool that made this book so wonderful. Together with a Dynamic Marriage class we are changed much for the better!!,

The V600 is approaching ""End-of-life"".Cingular recalled ALL of their V600s and replaced them.If T-Mobile cared about retaining their best customers, they would replace all V600s with a reliable phone.",
"__label__2 Absorbing: Reading this reminded me a little of Murakami's The WindUp Bird Chronicles in terms of the surrealism. There was a time when people were made of paper. A boy's cat is butchered and the grieving boy revivifies his cat by making paper organs and becomes the world's first origami surgeon. A woman is made of paper while her creature is left with multiple paper cuts all over his hands. A baby Nostradamus is born. A man loses his lime eating wife because he can't stop wetting the bed, and decides to travel to America with his daughter who attracts the attention of a carnation picker. It's a story of lost love, of planetary wars, the struggle for free will and ethnic issues.Certain chapters are told in columns which, to me, adds to the experience.This is not a book for everyone, and I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who doesn't already appreciate bizarre stories.",
"__label__2 At Last!!!: It's been a long wait, but it's been worth it. There hasn't been a really good literal tranlation on a character by character basis for a very long time, and not only does this book give us that at long last, but it also gives us an excellent English translation that captures the spirit and meaning of this most enigmatic of scriptures as well as the best out there. As the author says, this is only one possible translation, but then he procedes to give us the complete text in Chinese with all the varied possible English equivalents so we can proceed to make our own translation or come to terms with the full depth and range of meaning as never before.The lengthy chapter disecting the meaning and possible translations of the first verse, the kernal of the entire work, is worth the price of the whole volume. I only wish the author had done the same with ALL the verses!If I had to buy only one version of the venerable Tao Te Ching, this would have to be it!",
"__label__1 Disturbing is not a strong enough word...: I saw this ""film"" in its original released and it haunts me to this day. I remember some major cinema chains refused to show it and they were correct. The only intriguing part was the idea that the cast made up a late seventies all-star team of British film actors who proved that money is truly everything by agreeing to be part of this thing.I recall the review in the Boston Phoenix at the time which, if I am paraphrasing it correctly, said something like: Garbage over time equals swill; swill in great quantity equals poison.Run away...",

The only positive I can give it so far is our laptop shows 50+ mb/sec., but if I can't get our phones to work I will have no choice but to go back to the LinkSys for now and possibly return this one.. disappointed. I had planned to dd-wrt the old one and use it as a wirless adapter for my plasma/BlueRay.. obviously that is on hold.From my experience the old adage applies here, too good to be true :(Edit; got the phone issue fixed and has served us well for months w/ no problems - changed the rating to 4 stars to reflect this..",

The one thing that I find the most annoying is the buyer who seems to have a unique problem and posts comments slamming the product when the solution was truely outside the scope of the purchased item. Okay, all this lead in to say that these sheet are not very good. They are quite thin and do not fit well on the mattress size they are intended for. I wouldn't buy them again, I know they were not expensive, but even so, the quality is very low. Hope this helps you out!",

My stepdad likes something large and visibe, but not heavy or bulky.

"__label__1 An Accident: I had great expectations for this movie but it did not deliver. It's about the relationship that develops between a sheltered, over-religionized teenager, Ben who goes to work for over-medicated, hyper-eccentric washed-up actress Evie.The whole plot is predictable. It's obvious from the start that Ben's home life is tottering from the weight of over-religion. You see that coming form the first few scenes and can predict almost how it will end up and it ends up like you imagine. Evie's neediness borders on paralysis and it's painful to watch. Julie Walters plays a good turn as Evie but with a lack of charismatic acting by fellow lead Rupert Grint, it falls on Julie Walters and she just couldn't carry the movie alone.",
"__label__2 Well made bib.: This is a quality bib. I would have given it five stars, except that it could be improved by changing the strap that goes around your neck. If you put much in the bib, the nylon strap rubs and cuts into the back of your neck. A shirt collar helps, but I often work in a t-shirt. If they made a padded section around the neck, I'd give it five stars.",

"__label__1 Pros and Cons: It's got a nice bright bulb, and a very good, highly reflective cone which focuses the light well. The grip on the unit is pretty well-designed and comfortable as well.Unfortunately, that's the end of the pros. The switch is very sensitive, the slightest little touch or vibration and it turns on. I barely ever used it, but it was always dead when I needed it, and I had to replace the batteries every few weeks to keep it alive.Also, the cap on the bottom is very flexible and has very fine threads, so it's quite difficult to re-tighten the cap properly. The ring on the bottom is a very fragile piece of plastic, making the ring completely useless.I don't recomend this product.",
"__label__2 Pittsburgh's Chiller Theatre Original Theme: I purchased this album specifically for the first cut. This song, Experiment in Terror, written by Henry Mancini and performed by Al Ciaola was used by as the theme song for Pittsburgh's Saturday night ""Chiller Theatre"" on WIIC Channel 11 for many, many years. I have fond memories of the show and ""Chilly Billy Cardille"", the host. I've been looking for this song for thirty years.The other cuts are a quirky collection of songs used in movies, all good, and comprise a great soundtrack for an offbeat evening in the lounge.",

The forth song ""Unbound"" is particularly good. The fifth song (Sacrifice) is an unusual Indian convict rap that works. Sometimes I use its lyrics in my daily life (if I have to sacrifice some more...) This must be my favorite Robbie Robertson album, because I listen to it more than any of his others. If you are a Robbie Robertson fan you need this CD.Except for the day I bought this CD, I have never seen it for sale anywhere. Amazon may be the last place left where you can.",
"__label__1 No Power: The book of Acts is a book of power! Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation. The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story. Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it two stars. Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers. All of that is lost in the DVD presentation.I would not recommend this DVD. Stick to the Book instead.",

"__label__2 Excellent: Basil Kirchin works with electirc harpsichord, percussion and a few reeds on Abstractions For The Industral North. With such a narrow scope, the music remains spare throughout. This is basically variations on one or two themes.Which does not make it repetative or boring. The melodies are so light and transparent, this album maintains a pastoral feel throughout. Kirchen works enough permutations, both in the writting and arranging, for Abstractions...to hold your attention.Kirchin worked a lot on 1960s soundtracks. I don't think this album is for a particular movie, but it defiantely has the nuance of 60s film music. The electric harpsichord in particular gives the album that post Sgt. Pepper barouqe feel everyone was aiming for.Kirchin should have worked with the Zombies or Left Banke. That would have matched perfectly.But, trust me. This will more than do.",

And nothing happened! No voices, no smoke, no lasers, nothing!

I bought it because my sister is converting to Mormonism, much to the shock and displeasure of my family, and I wanted to learn more about the LDS Church, especially from someone who decided to leave it. I wanted a fair, factual, intelligent, balanced picture of Mormonism. I did not want something written with a harsh, narrow-minded ""fundamentalist Christian"" slant, like The God Makers. Well, that's what this book is. Near the end of the book, you will find out that the author and her husband were interviewed for The God Makers documentary, which, if you don't know, is an extremist, inflamatory, biased, unbalanced look at the Mormon church. This book does not provide a fair and balanced look at Mormonism, so if that's what you're looking for do not buy this book.",

There were points that were so disgusting that it was repulsive, other articles were just plain stupid. if the point of the book is just to shock people it doesn't work, it just leaves the reader wondering what the point of the book was because it isn't that shocking and it only has a few articles that are repulsive. the weird thing is, i want to perhaps read the second apocalypse book. can't explain why.",

He enjoys the stories very much and the chapters lengths are minimal. He easily gets a good 10 minutes read each evening with only an occasional difficult word. He enjoys them so much that now I don't even have to remind him that he needs to read a chapter ... I look in to his room at night and he already has the book out!

I decided to pick up the book and happened to start right at the beginning of Emerald Twilight. I was horrified. Hal turned into a mass murderer, killing his trusted friends and stealing the power battery's power. While I liked his replacement, Kyle Rayner, I grew to understand the importance that Hal Jordan held in the GL mythos. Emerald Twilight was a travesty.",

"__label__1 Arrived Broken, Twice!: Like the previous reviewer, my bowls arrived smashed to bits. The packaging for the bowls is laughable -- they come nested together with no protection, and are placed in a box that is too small for them. I returned the first set and asked for a replacement, which also arrived broken. Now I'm returning the second set for a refund. At least amazon makes returns very easy!The bowls look nice, but they aren't worth ordering. Too bad.",

"__label__1 Way over their heads: I purchased this dvd for $5 shipped and thought it would be a great deal, but I was wrong. I admire the creator Phil Vischer and thought the content would be really sound. The content was fine, but the delivery was not geared towards young children. Having witty puppets intermingled with explanations about the Septuagint is not going to keep the attention of the average child. My five-year-old and three-year-old were quickly lost and never regained much interest. I gave it two stars because I learned some things, but I'm guessing that I'm not their target audience.",
__label__2 Evocative & Eclectic: Just an absolutely amazing album. This genius collection of songs was probably one of my biggest musical influences.,
"__label__1 Soft Metal Means These Break After 1-2 Uses: I was thrilled when these arrived in the mail. The price seemed unbeatable, and they fit securely to all of my standard bits. However, the metal in the hex screws is very soft, and after only 1 use the heads were completely stripped -- making these stop collars completely useless.I was using these in a fine woodworking application. But perhaps if you just wanted to use them as a guide for drilling into drywall, plaster, etc., then you could secure them less tightly to your bits (and thus, hopefully, delay stripping the cheap screws).",

"__label__1 By a CD player that is reliable and will last: I had wanted a CD player that would play lullabies for my son to help him relax and go to sleep. I returned this player 3 times before completely giving up on it. Every model I brought home failed to play an entire CD. It didn't matter whether it was sitting on a table or mounted on the side of the crib. It would stutter, skip, or just plain stop.For the same price, I bought a great little colorful Sony boom box with a ton of features that hasn't missed a beat. What's even better - it will be useful to my son when he is old enough to play his own CDs and carry it around - a much better investment.",
"__label__2 if you think you know Donny Osmond's music, think again!: If you are one of the many that have a preconceived notion of Donny Osmond based on a very old image, buy this DVD and you'll never think of him the same way again.

"__label__2 Best Christmas Present I ever gave: My father is hard to buy for. On a hunch, I bought him this CD, as I knew he was thinking about the war a lot. In all honesty, I thought he would play the CD once, and that would be it. At least once a month, my father comments on how much he values this album. He never removes it from his player. It has moved him and, in its own way, I think, provided some sense of peace about a troubled time.",

"__label__1 Doesn't Work!: Even after reading all the negative reviews, I decided to purchase the unit hoping I wouldn't have the same problems. Well I didn't have the same problem (at least I didn't find one similar to my own). I prepped the unit as the directions described however my machine made a horrible noise. I don't know what it was doing but it was making a buzzing noise that was really loud but continued to pour water into my mug. After the cycle finished I tried the unit with a coffee pod. Nothing. Nothing happens. I've unplugged the unit and replugged it in. I have removed and reinserted the water container. I have unlocked and relocked the pod unit. When I press any of the buttons, nothing happens. It's like it's dead. I called their customer service number and he basically told me to do everything I've already tried. So I guess I will be returning it today and will give it another try. If I have issues with that one I'll just get my money back and wait until a new and improved unit comes out.",
"__label__2 A steal: This has been a good year for soundtracks. First ""Oh Brother..."", now Snatch. A great soundtrack should not carry the movie, but the mood, and the eclectic, shall I say, whimsical, nature of this collection really brings out the scenes. Even as one listens to the soundtrack alone after seeing the flick, details of the relevant scenes pop up. There is an incredible amount of energy here, and there has to be, to keep up with the disjointed, parallel-plotted movie. This soundtrack has the feel of a road-trip mix made by a friend of diverse musical tastes.",
"__label__1 Please don't use bleach to clean your teeth: Despite the ""advice"" of the dental hygenist mentioned below, please do not use a diluted bleach solution to clean your teeth. Bleach is toxic. Use diluted Listerine or other antibacterial mouthwash.I bought this model, and the jury is still out as far as reliability. Mine worked the first time, at least. I have to agree that it is amazingly loud, even with a towel underneath. And yes, I fear my neighbors will think I'm running a lawnmower in the bathroom. The tongue scraper attachment seems worthlessly small; buy a stainless steel one instead for $3. Yes, the cord is too short and the unit is difficult to maneuver. But if you follow the directions enclosed in the package, you won't make such a huge mess.",
"__label__1 For lovers of the series ""Cranford."": Since I loved the PBS series ""Cranford,"" I wanted more. The series are supposed to be based on a couple of Gaskell's books, so I bought Cranford and this one. There was nothing of the TV series that came from ""North and South."" The book was pretty slow going at first, but since I loved Cranford, I stuck with it. I'm not sure that to enjoy the ending you really needed all of the little details. There is a family prominent to the story that added nothing and wasted a lot of pages, in my opinion. But I guess they are there to illustrate both sides of the economic life. It's not a book I would read again. But the ending made up for all the slogging through I had to do to get there. Now that I've read what I wrote, I'd have to say that it really wasn't worth all the time I spent reading it.",
__label__1 How to be Your Own Herbal Pharmacist: I was very disappointed as this book contains no herbal formulas. There are a few formulas for cosmetics and aromatherapy but not for the herbs. It has some useful information regarding the uses of a large number of herbs but without the measurements to mix the formulas it can not be true to the title.,

"__label__1 Much Less Than One Star: I bought this book on the basis of customer reviews. The reviewers must be very good friends of the author, or the author himself, although they were well written and his book was not. I just put it into the recycling. I can't imagine who I'd pass it on to. The writing is incredibly pedestrian, full of cliches -- but worse, the morality is that of a six year old -- eye for an eye. I'm half afraid the author will go after ME for writing this review -- but hey, save your money. Also -- I received an anonymous letter recommending this book. Obviously, the sender was afraid to reveal his/her identity as well! Anyone can write a book and anyone can publish -- buyer beware.",

"__label__2 Best reading instruction book out there!: This book was recommended to me by a friend when my eldest child was 4. She had a great time going through the lessons- and, the biggest surprise of all- so did I! I have no real instinct or patience for teaching, so the fact that everything I was supposed to say, down to how to correct an error, was scripted for me was my saving grace- Hallelujah!That same child is now 7, in second grade (after skipping first grade) and is in the top reading group in her class. I can only credit the foundation that this book taught for that success!I'm working with her younger sister now, and she loves it just as much. I even bribed her to eat all her dinner one night by offering to let her have another lesson after we finished. :D Our little boy (age 2 1/2) will sit at the table and try to mimic what my current 4-year old is doing. Looks like we'll have no trouble getting him started in a year or so as well. :)",

If you've read the Magnus Pack series by Shelly Laurenston and liked it, then I think you'll also like this series.I liked the close-knit family aspect and the do-anything-for-my-mate heroes. No, the series doesn't require a lot of deep thought to read, but it is enjoyable. I finished each book in an afternoon.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the language. However, I read Laurenston's series and it is covered in language too, so it didn't totally put me off. It just made me cringe a little.This series is a keeper, and I can see myself rereading the books in the future.",

Although functional, it is cumbersome and tough to open without removing the door. I believe a minor redesign of the door hinges would greatly improve the composter.",
"__label__1 Should be called ""How to Breastfeed your child until age seven"": This book had very little information on weaning, or even child led weaning. It had plenty of anecdotes about mothers who continued nursing their children until the child was four, five, six, and if I remember correctly, seven years old. Even for a mother who has nursed three children for over two years each, it was a little weird and also just plain funny. I shared it with some friends and we all became like snickering teenagers. It was not helpful with my plan to gradually wean my toddler. If you are looking for support for very extended breastfeeding, here it is.",
"__label__2 Sounds like a roller rink but in a good way: I really like LRD's remix of Cassius's song Feeling for you and this CD is the same style. It does have eighties style digitized rythm and I think its sneaky for him to pose as a French guy (though maybe thats those badboys at Astralwerks) but its a cool disc. You could definitely do worse. Also, it is consistent. So if you like a song you heard somewhere by him, you'll like the album.",

"__label__1 This lock is junk.: This lock sucks, plain and simple. The key is difficult to insert and remove, it is not a smooth feeling and you have to fight it to get it in or out, and visually the key hole looks like raw cut metal with jagged edges. It looks like a piece of crap on the mailbox!It's working temporarily since it's (only slightly) better than the lock that was being replaced but it's going in the trash as soon as I go to the local home hardware superstore to get a different lock.The product I received for ordering this ""EZ-Flo"" lock was a Guard Security mailbox lock part number 127/5 and nowhere does it say EZ-Flo so maybe I did not get the product that I thought I ordered.

__label__2 Great deal for the price.: I bought this grooming kit to replace a broken part (foil micro shaver) from a kit I bought at Costco a few years ago. The price for this whole kit was the same as the replacement attachment! Now I have plenty of extra parts as the originals wear out.,
"__label__1 I finished reading it just to see if it improves at the end: The character is a lame fellow who decides to marry a woman he dislikes because he fells in love with her sister. All the pages of the novel are washed away describing inconsequential conducts and behaviors. I fail to see anything funny or at least an issue worth discussing with a friend, let alone explain to him/her what the book is about. Its theme is actually about nothing. Indeed my feelings for this book contradicts the enthusiastic reviews offered by other fellows, and I am surprised because some books which I have bought from Amazon.com based on the popular opinion have not disappointed me. Well, I guess there is always an exception to a rule.",
"__label__2 Yearning! Epic! Energy!: Great CD, it still has that big-screen feel of their debut. Nothing is small on this album. They have a their own sound that makes me think of orchestras. Would definitely recommend buying it. Am giving 4 stars not 5 because it's not as amazing as their EP. After 'no cars go', nothing on this album quite hits me the same way.",
"__label__2 Collection of hits from 71-72: All original hits. The songs on this CD are all wonderful, considering their breadth of style. Song list (since it's not listed):1. Brand New Key - Melanie2. Clean Up Woman - Betty Wright3. Jungle Fever - Chakachas4. Nice To Be With You - Gallery5. Suavecito - Malo6. I Gotcha - Joe Tex7. Hot Rod Lincoln - Commander Cody & Lost Planet Airmen8. Oh Girl - Chi-Lites9. How Do You Do? - Mouth & MacNeal10. Rock Steady - Aretha FranklinThis collection of hit songs is especially interesting. Humor songs are well represented in Hot Rod Lincoln and I Gotcha. Funky, danceable numbers are included in Rock Steady, Clean Up Woman, and the risque Jungle Fever. Oh Girl is a classic soul ballad, whereas the soft Suavecito has a slight Latin flair. Brand New Key and How Do You Do could be described as cutesy, whereas Nice To Be With You is good mainstream pop. Many of these songs are otherwise hard to find. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes great early 70s hit songs.",
"__label__1 A touch of class: E.M.Forster is a semi-classical English writer, who produced numerous novels set in the early 20th century. Later, film director James Ivory (an American, strange as it may seem) made a career for himself by turning these books into movies. ""A Room with a View"" is what you could have called ""Proletarian literature"" in Soviet literary canon; only working-class setting is replaced by the British ""proper"" society, still unscathed by the Great War. I have a thing for this epoch, but Forster's book does not reflect its charm in the least. All because of its social message. No gripping plot, no character development, no psychological motivations. The only really enthralling thing is to observe to what degree did the English train their language to conceal feelings. It is what makes the books like Forster's or Ishiguro's ""Remains of the Day"" almost untranslatable. In Forster's case, though, no harm done.",
"__label__2 A great ending...: A 3 book series that is well worth the read. Clever and well written. A little dated but hey, what can you do?

"__label__2 Metallica is back and badder than ever!: Holy hell in a hand bag does this album rock! Metallica is back and they mean business. Lars Ulrich has brought in the big guns with double bass in about every song, and you can literally hear Jaymz and Kirk pour their hearts out in their monster riffs that flys like fire through their finger tips. Oh and minus one bass player? Bob Rock stepped up and took care of the bass beautifully. This album shows Metallica going back to their roots, back to the ""Kill em all"" and ""Justice"" days when they were heavier than ever. You can't go wrong with the songs such as St. Anger, Frantic, and Invisible Kid. They are all SO AWESOME!! If you are a Metallica fan then this is the album for you, happy listening Metallica friends!",

"__label__2 Canon PowerShot SD800 IS: In addition to taking great pictures - and having optical image stabilization, this camera has a lens which can shoot 28mm wide angle(in 35mm film terms)pictures plus it has an eye level optical finder which makes the camera easier to hold steady and easier to use in bright sunlight. - Canon still produces a camera in this series with similar wide angle capability, but the eye level finder has been eliminated on that model has been eliminated - More than 7.1 megapixels in a small sensor camera like this would not not significantly improve the picture quality - and may actually create more noise. Yet this camera is less expensive than the newest model. - Grab one before they are all gone.",
"__label__1 Horrible record label rip-off release: I'd give it zero stars if I could. Record labels should be shot for releasing trash like this. This is already available as the Live In 99 DVD. Difference is, Live In 99 is the full show; this is edited down to maybe half of that release AND they resequenced the songs to where they are completely out of order from the way there were performed. Example: George doesn't open with Bad To The Bone on Live In 99 but does here. It looks stupid here because he is already sweaty whereas on Live In 99, he opens with Be Bop Grandma and is dry as a bone. Be Bop Grandma appears about halfway through this release, so for him to start out soaking wet and be dry halfway through the show, it's just so inconsistent as to be stupid. The performance is great, but skip this and get the real deal for maximum enjoyment.",

The pump works well, but mine arrived looking like a soccer team all took turns with free kicks before delivery. The unit's housing has a 1 1/2 inch chip broken off the cover, but I decided to glue the chip back rather than return the product. The pump works well, but water remains in the holding tank after cycling, so keep the unit from freezing and watch for mold growth. I add bleach to my every so often.",

Eco, an Italian, has a few books set in the same part of the word, though a couple hundred years earlier.This book is, of course, a way to learn about Michaelangelo, and a lot of the factual information is interesting and well-researched.

I had high hopes but was soon disappointed with how it did not hold together. The BIGGEST problem was the wheels on the rug head. They fell off constantly forcing us to use duct tape and other measures just to keep it functioning. The hose connection is also weak and it would either overheat and quit or lose the connection, we are not sure which. We finally had to buy another vacuum cleaner after just two years, but for the money, this should last for years.

Unfortunately, this book lacked a basic procedure on how to punch down strands of 4-pair on to a punch down block. Another example, the 568a / 568b issues are poorly explained. Therefore, if you need real, hands-on information for an implementation, then move on to another book, perhaps one from BCSI, or perhaps the Sybex book by Groth and McBee.",

"__label__1 Poorly made: I got this for Christmas, and it's a mixed review for me. I'm actually pleased with the sound, as I wanted this for my office at work. Just wanted something I could plug my nano in and so replace the boombox I had here. So for what is required of it, I have no problems with the sound, as I never really crank it up. However, the 'visual' component was a major disappointment. Within a week the 'bulb' at the top no longer functioned. I gather there is a short of some type, as if I push down on the glass ball on top I'll get a visual light effect for 2 seconds. Otherwise, nothing. Since part of the appeal of this was to have the light effects WITH the speakers, I'd have to advise caution in buying this. You can probably get speakers just as good cheaper elsewhere, and my experience says you are rolling the dice if you are buying this for the light effects as well.",
"__label__2 Summer No Ka Oi: An intriguing look at the beauty that was Hawaii's first capitol, Lahaina. Personally, this book evoked memories buried deep in my heart. The collection of photos and the author's eloquent writing combine to create a book of high caliber. It is evident that Ms. Kupau is quite knowledgeable of Lahaina's history. This volume of the ""small town series"" allowed me to relive the vivid images of Lahaina that was my youth. Sigh. I remember my old friend Edith Miyahira and her two daughters Jean & Jane who operated the jewel of the Front Street restaurants at the time, Seaside. The home made saimin, fried rice, shrimp curry, hamburger steak and potato salad were among my favorites. Just thinking about the food makes my mouth water. Emeril could learn a thing or two from Edith. BAM! In conclusion, I am anxiously waiting Summer Kupau's next book. She is an excellent author. Keep it real, keep it old school.",

Not to mention... in an aquarium with species that DON'T live with these turtles in the wild! Didn't you think at least SOMEONE out there would take notice? The endless irritating shots of these turtles supposedly sharing an environment with brine shrimp (""Sea-Monkeys""), which only occur naturally in still-water salt lakes as in The Great Salt Lake, which are so saline, only these brine shrimp (hence their name) and a few fly species can survive, was shameful to relate to the public.

Because the books are written from a first person perspective, there is a special opportunity for audio books. Burt Reynolds takes advantage of that opportunity. His character portrayals are excellent.Reynolds delivery is outstanding. He doesn't try too hard. His timing is great. Sometimes it's almost like he is talking specifically to me, not to a room of people - like he is responding to my feedback or something! He portrays the characters as I imagined them before I ever listened to a Spencer audiobook. (I didn't watch the TV series more than a couple times.)Even without Reynolds, ""Chance"" is an interesting story, with a good balance between action & dialog, plot & character development. With Reynolds, it is six stars!",

"__label__1 John Doe: Unfortunately I am one of those people who crave the release of a new Tom Clancy novel, however, being so few and far between, I have found myself passing time reading non-fiction books and research on specialized warfare. It becomes painfully obvious within the first few chapters of this book that Tom didn't do his research. He may have gotten a little information, but he most certainly made most of it up.Being well versed, myself, in the tactics, weaponry, and explosives used by spec-warriors, his accounts lacked realism. His depiction of British SAS standards, German GSG-9, and some US forces just weren't true to the levels that these individuals truly prepare for.I must admit I tended to enjoy the tedious technicalities in Clancy's novels, but in this one, the technicalities are WRONG, and I found myself agitated when reading them.If you enjoy quite a few action scenes with predicatble outcomes, this one's for you, but if you know anything about specwar, stay away from it.",

Also, when you finish the limited game play, it ends with a great big movie ad for the next movie due out later this year. That's pretty crass.

"__label__1 Goodnight No Thanks: I have to agree that this is a somewhat lackluster book. The protagonist, Kate Klein, is the prototypical Jennifer Weiner main character: thirtyish, Jewish, overweight, inappropriately (verging on annoyingly) clownish, and caught between the professional world and domestic concerns.The book is basically a chick-lit murder mystery. As with other Weiner stories, it conflates the fantastical and outlandish with the mundane, a formula that doesn't feel natural to me at all (e.g., when put on the spot at Kitty's funeral, Kate ends up singing ""If You're Happy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands"" during a misguided eulogy--so over-the-top and not very funny).I find most of Weiner's characters to be uneven and underdeveloped, and Goodnight Nobody's are no exception.

"__label__1 Depressing: First off, let me say that I think BLONDIE is one of the best bands ever. Period. But this concert comes to us from a very low point in their career. Back in 1982, BLONDIE was on its last legs (the first time around). They all hated each other, Frank Infante was suing the band and has been last-minute replaced by some black guy. Chris Stein was at the beginning stages of a disease that almost killed him - and it shows. Debbie had already released a solo album at this point and looks very bored. Even BLONDIE didn't like themselves at this stage in the game.If you are a big fan, you will want to pick this up as a timepiece.

Then Thrawn comes back from the dead ready to lead the Imperials to victory while the Republic destroys itself.

"__label__1 Pretty awful, like a mix of Cirque de Soleil and ballet, but ...: ... one interesting thing I noticed is that some of the dance pieces bear a resemblance to ideas from ballets well-known in the 1970's and/or 1980's, such as ""Paradise Lost"" (choreographer maybe Glen Tetley, notoriously danced by Nureyev and Fonteyn at their height of being Mod superstars. The sets had a luscious mouth that Nureyev dove thru, outrageously. Other dancing reminded me of ""The Ropes of Time"" (choreographed by Rudi van Dantzig, I think, and famously danced by Nureyev, among others).It took me awhile to realize I was looking at Malcolm McDowell, the white hair confused me. After 30 years he looks a lot different (don't we all). I always liked that guy, I wonder what made him participate in this fiasco.Cirque de Soleil can be enjoyable, and I like ballet, but the two combine badly.Rent this somewhere, if you must.",

"__label__2 Very funny Abbott & Costello comedy: Bud Abbott and Lou Costello are sidewalk photographers who get mixed up with bank robbers and wind up at a ski resort. This film has the famous A & C verbal humor, and plenty of visual comedy, too. Lou's mishaps on a skating rink are amusing, and a frantic chase finale has Lou turning into a giant snowball! The supporting cast features Sheldon Leonard as the criminal mastermind, and fans of '40s music will enjoy vocalist Ginny Simms. If you saw this on TV years ago, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the print quality of this edition. Replicating the original theatrical viewing experience, the tape includes two coming-attractions previews (the first trailer is the only segment boasting less-than-superior quality), and you'll also see a Woody Woodpecker cartoon and a documentary short about exotic birds. A fine show from Universal.",

Glib, smart-alecky, first-draft-feeling, it just felt too loose and unedited, un-thought-out. No style. More like a boilerplate for people wanting to make a quick buck writing easy paperback mysteries. I skipped around in the book after that, but nothing caught my attention. I even finally read the last few pages, but all I realized was that I would never be able to endure this character for a whole book, much less a whole series. Stephanie Lemon, I'd say.",

The only good things about this video were, obviously Tony Levin, but then all of the props Pete was using throughout the concert. The new drummer is the most boring guy to watch since Peter Criss...Although, his old stuff with KISS was fairly exciting...but this guy butchers classic songs. Then theres the fact that Pete also got rid of his old keyboardist - again. Now its a boring woman with no real show of talent. Pete also brought his daughter along, but she can get kind of annoying at times. Overall, if you liked UP, get this DVD; if you prefer classic Pete stuff, avoid this DVD.",

My friend purchased a Emjoi facial product six months ago which sounds like it is on its last leg as well. We definitely won't make the Emjoi mistake again, and we won't be lured into Emjoi again with discount coupon deals. There is a reason that manufacturers offer seemingly nice discount coupons, and the Emjoi reason is that their products just don't last. As other people have posted, Emjoi products die early deaths. It certainly is disappointing to waste so much money.",
"__label__2 Adventure story in the land of the Northern Lights: This was a hard book to put down once I'd started. The story has a stranded Canadian sailor, John McLennan, as its main character, whose life is saved by the Chukchi. During his becoming adapted to their way of life and marrying among them, he finds the English language useful in communicating with and warding off occasional scientific explorers and other adventurers, who find these inhabitants and their land of Wrangel Island off Siberia tempting prey for get-rich schemers. The full range of lean and prosperous seasons in the stark, isolated landscape circa 1910 to 1917 is heartbreaking and joyous in turns. The reader will find plenty of walrus and nerpa and other sea animals and their usefulness to wonder at. The flavor of the this slice of life comes through too from the translator's leaving in some authentic everyday words, whose meaning is immediately appararent from the context or the aid right at the bottom of the page.",

When the raking finished she jumped in again and then jumped out. Then she laid there to wait for the raking to begin again. I also bought one for the upstairs and have had no problems with that one either. I am looking forward to less mess and smell. I can see and smell the difference already.,

Once again, Dereske gives us a fast-paced thriller that's hard to put down. She develops the characters introduced in the first book and adds a touch of romance, scandal, threats, anonymous letters, fog, and, of course, murder.

"__label__1 Shut Up and Think: Wow. The title is so offensive I just had to write the review. I did read the book, and while it presents compelling internal logic, I think it has a slight problem. Internal logic doesn't need to consider external reality. That is why people claim that they can prove the ""international Jewry"" run the media. A logic that does not take into acount the external is fiction, because it doesn't look at what is real. This sort of book I will call ""current event historial fiction."" For instance: Despite what this book implies, the wealthy should probably have more of their income taxed than the poor. Say you make $2.5 milion a year. Given a 25% tax, you pocket $1,875,000 a year. If you make $25,000 a year, you pocket $18,750. Yet the poor get taxed more than the rich because the rich supposedly earned all of their money, whereas poor and undereducated minority workers are lazy. I hate books that say that sort of thing.",

The problem is that it doesn't come with the link spring frame that the mattress sits on. The description says it does not include accessories or mattress. I thought accessories meant the bedding. I would never assume the frame wasn't included. They need to be more clear. To order that part, shipped to my area is $172.14. That makes the cost of the bed closer to $800. I think I could have found it cheaper elsewhere. Just do a search for Saigon Daybed on internet, other companies sell it.The only other thing is that the top piece on the back and the sides is wicker. It is pretty, but it looked like wood to me in the picture. I wondered where the wicker was!!",

The music and environment shots were too long and horrible- as boring as Blade Runner. There are a lot of incomprehensible technotalk scenes AND lots of philosophical psycho-babble scenes.

The ""early sounds"" are so tight. Makes me remember being there in Byron. The sound quality of the recording is quite good and brings back the jammin' sounds that made the Allman Brothers one of the ushers of Southern Rock. I favor the first day recording over the second, but both are superb. After some 33 years, the sounds are still classic and fresh. How is that? Because the Allman Brothers will remain one of the benchmark bands of rock. Favorite songs are Elizabeth Reed, Whipping Post, and Statesboro Blues. Whether the Brothers wrote it or re-arranged it, the sounds on the Festival album are on any real fan's ""must have"" list. Buy, I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Trust me!!",

I wont get into the confusing arguments about ""this happened because, the younger self did yada yada yada"", but I will say that after the last act of the film... NONE of the events prior should have happened -- but it did happen even though ""Character XYZ"" NEVER EXISTED. People still remember ""Character XYZ"" even though he/she NEVER EXISTED.

Pretty much everything in this book is wonderful. It will definitely take either an extremely talented classical pianist and/or a strong reader in chords and feel for the songs to play a lot of these accompaniment parts, but they are some of the most enjoyable songs to play. My only reason I am giving the songbook 4 stars is because it doesn't have 'There is A Fount/God This Don't Make Sense' in here.

This DVD includes indepth interviews with Mark, Tom, & Travis, the making of ""The Rock Show"", ""First Date"", & ""Stay Together For The Kids"" music videos. It also includes behind the scenes footage of blink-182 tour life, what goes on backstage, and while in the recording studio, & so much more. My favorite part of the DVD is right before the credits when Mark, Tom, & Travis talk about their friendship and the band to ""What Went Wrong"". Honestly, I would buy this DVD even if that was the only part it had on it. This DVD does have a PARENTAL ADVISORY warning on it, but it is mainly for the language in their songs. The Urethra Chronicles, Vol. II = Great Buy!",
"__label__2 Wow: Adam Scott wasn't really on my radar but I caught him in the last Season 2 episode of Eastbound and Down. A couple nights later, ""The Vicious Kind"" was on one of my cable channels. Good God. He has such a delicate face, but with the facial hair, it seemed to help in changing his persona. Really good movie and he was smoking hot in it.",
__label__1 Constant Paper Jams: This printer worked great for 6 months ink was fine nice photo quality on prints.Now everytime I try to print the paper jams.

"__label__2 Quick miss spelled word corrector.: I just got mine a few hours ago, so I'll just hit the high points here.1. Multifunctional2. Cheap!3. It took me one minute to get it going, (with one eye on the instructions and the other on the keyboard.) I got it right the first time.CONS:(There are some, but nothing of concern)1. If you were four years old, (skinny fingers) you could use the keyboard like a typewriter. As an adult, if you line up all four of your fingers on both hands--squeeze them together--they are still too big to type on it.--but so what, you knew it was small before you bought it.2. 500,000 words would have been a lot better for me instead of 110,000 words. (getting an update for a couple of bucks, from the company, with another 2 or 3 hundred thousand words- would have been nice. I didn't get it for the games or SAT's--I would rather have had the addition words.But did I forget to mention it's CHEAP!...EASY TO USE!...WORTH IT!?BYE!",
"__label__2 Good addition to your movie library: This movie pokes fun at all of the politically correct thinkers. Its good mindless fun, but those who expect seriousness should avoid this one!The movie centers around a basic idea: Too many people are uptight, and just don't know how to have a good time. This movie is good for laughs and shouldn't offend anyone (unless they want to be offended)I had the tape version, and nabbed the DVD as soon as it came out.Heartily recommend it.",
"__label__2 Great headphones: I love these headphones, the only down side is they tend to slip off your head if you lean over. Other than that they come in loud and clear when I watch TV, plus if you go into another room you can continue to hear the TV. I would recommend these headphones.",

"__label__1 Art or Pomposity?: A Massive Attack fan to the death, I was sorely disappointed by this collection of videos. Since the release of ""Mezannine,"" I would say that Del Naja has become the Bono of the early-mid nineties: pompous and a bit self-righteous. Where I would have hoped to see some experimental music video directing, this collection is mostly a jumbled together collection of cheesecake closeups of the ever-scowling 3-D. Advance listenings of ""100th Window"" portends more pseudo-art from this great band. One expects more from the greatest band of the late twentieth century.",
__label__1 Mothman Fiction: The author claims the book is factual. My gut feeling is it's fictional. As fiction it is not well written. Just a bunch of short tales kind of mixed together.,

__label__2 NJ Tax Liens: This book is very informative. The chapter on foreclosure is only something a lawyer has knowledge of. The appendix is great because it contains many of the essential documents needed for tax lien investing. The only thing I thought the book was missing was some more detailed profit calculations/interest accruals on subsequent taxes. A nice walk-through cash flow example would have made this book a 5/5.,
"__label__2 Why didn't I order this sooner?: This was much better than I expected. Went together in minutes without any tools. Mine is in the garage, and so far I don't feel I need to attach it to the wall. I dropped one of the arms during installation and the flat piece that goes against the main bar got a little bent, but it's still functional. I'm really impressed with this stand, it's sturdy and yet light and needs no tools, and I was able to put two types of women's bikes on there adjusting the arms as needed. No need to add a straight bar to ladies bikes!Very, very happy with this.",

"__label__2 A great person, a great voice, a great album!: Hey, like most of you, I think that Lila is also sooo underrated, it's not fair because she is really good. She has an outstanding voice not like most other country singers. I personally know because I have a karaoke system in my house and I pop in CD's every once in a while to sing to when I'm bored. Now, I think I have fairly an average voice and man, I can't pull off the songs as good as Lila can on this CD, while I think I'm better than Shania Twain when I sing her songs, because I guess they don't require that much vocal talent and does not have a lot of difficulty. Man, I got to give it up for Lila for doing so great on all the songs. So yeah, this is a great album with a great variety of songs, from the upbeat dances and ballads, to the inbetweens--it just has it all. Want to find some more underrated artists? Check out Hoku and Jennifer Love Hewitt.",
__label__2 It's Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy: Outstanding example of the way things should be done! Wonderful and helpful insight. Thank you.,
"__label__2 Great for begginers: This book show those tricks you always wanted to do but you never had someone to teach you! Stunts like guessing cards and false shuffles are explained in this book with illustrations. These 101 card tricks are also rated by mastery level in the index, to make you advance slowly in your skill level. An excelent book. I also recommend ""World's Best Coin Tricks"", also by Bob Longe.",
"__label__2 Breathless: Awesome, gorgeous, exquisite, exhilirating...I don't have words. The technical prouesse is nothing short of astonishing: one has to try and imagine the sheer physical difficulty of handling the double bass, the physical effort invoved in playing this most awkward of instruments, its bulk, the weight of its strings, the inertia of the bow. Then there's the beauty of the double bass: the volume, the overtones, the basses, the harmonics. And then there's Meyer... Casals' recordings are a must, and unsurpassed on the cello. What Meyer does here is add another dimension, literally: using the bass' limitations, he makes them work for him, for the music, for us and for our enjoyment. This is art of the highest order, beautifully recorded and produced. Even if you have Casals' recordings, get these. They'll change the way you hear the Suites",
"__label__1 Do not waste your time!: This film was a disappointment to me. Even though the director has modernised the film, it still seems ""wrong"" somewhere. I dont know if its cos of the dialogue.Learnado Dicaprio is definately not the right person to play Romeo, neither is Claire Danes. Is it just me, but arent Romeo and Juliet supposed to be good looking? Neither of them are even remotely good looking. This film would Definately put people off Shakespeare, So i recommend that you read the book first before attempting to watch this atrocity.",
"__label__2 Best cake pan I've ever used: No more oiling and flouring cake pans!My specialty cake is a very rich, dense chocolate, and it sticks like nobody's business to metal and glass pans - but pops right out of these!I love that these pans have ""handles"" on the sides, a lot of silicon pans don't have that, and I end up sticking my hot mitt into whatever I'm baking getting it out of the oven.I've used silicon for years and never had a problem with uneven baking like the negative reviewer here - have to wonder whether that was just a fluke/user error. :)",
"__label__1 Bad, bad, way bad!: It is not often that I give up on a book without finishing it -- but with this book I had to. Too many details, unbecomming characters, full of typos, and nothing that really sets the hook. Having read quite a bit in the chicklit genre -- this should not be included in the same classification. Yes, the main character is a woman. Yes, she is 20 or 30-something. But the similarity stops there. Don't bother with this one ladies. It left me frustrated and needing to find a good book quickly to make up for lost time spent with this one.",
__label__2 Fair fairy drawing: This book is easy to use and to read with some amusing and interesting fairy facts the sketched and line drawings are worth a good look at and the part about the different types of wings is acurate and interesting.I love the book and the ideas for changing the types of fairy's eg attitude and style.,
"__label__1 Not the Same as the Old Splintertweeze: I bought these tweezers to replace my old Tweezerman Splintertweeze tweezers. They are not the same at all. The tips are not nearly as pointed (too wide to use precisely) or as flush (won't grasp well). I have always sworn by Tweezerman, but it seems like the quality of their products has really been declining lately. Being fairly clumsy I often ruin my tweezers by dropping them, and it seems like each replacement pair I buy is worse than the last. I bought my first Splintertweeze because I was sorely disappointed by a very dull pair of Point tweezers that I bought to replace my old ones, and now this new Splintertweeze is almost as bad as those Point tweezers were! I am sure that somebody who is used to drugstore tweezers would probably find these a nice upgrade, but if you're used to Tweezerman quality, beware. It ain't what it used to be.",
"__label__2 Adult trike fenders: These fenders fit a 24"" tire adult Torker trike. I was trying to get them for my Miami Sun trike, but they did not fit and had to return. On the flip side, they are oh so cool looking and very retro with the reflectors. Also, nice quality.",
"__label__1 Buffalo Bill and the Indians: A terrific Robert Altman film done wrong by MGM and then by Amazon. This disc is NOT anamorphic as described but what is called ""widescreen"". That is, it will not stretch across your TV screen but will by contained in a small rectangle.This is false advertising as I, for one, would never have bought this title if it was advertised correctly. I bought this thru moviemars via Amazon.",

"__label__1 Total Rip Off -- Deserves Zero Stars: I did not expect high quality stones due to the price, but I certainly didn't expect such horrible quality.Both stones and dull and extremely cloudy. They also have huge inclusions right on their surfaces. They are gray in color (not close to black as shown in the picture). One is darker than the other. Even though their color would hide most flaws, the quality is so obviously poor it would be embarrassing for anyone to wear them.I also would like to note that the white gold settings are not as shown in the picture. The stones are propped up on top of settings so the white gold cannot be seen on the perimeter when viewed directly from the front.I ordered them a couple of days ago but now when I view the item, it says ""Item under review"" due to customer feedback. I'm guessing other customers have complained about being sent two lumps of coal too!!Returning immediately. Not worth more than $10. You're better off buying something made of plastic from a bead store.",
"__label__1 Abysmal!: As a soon-to-graduate Kellogg student, I thought this text might give me better insight into the case interviews that the management consulting firms use while recruiting. I was disappointed to find that this book provides only a few pages on case analysis; the remainder of the book is devoted to such topics as ""seat visibility in the case classroom"". If Dickens, dead drunk, were to try to write a very dry overview of the case method in a classroom setting, he might pen this text on a very bad day. Save your money and go to VaultReports.COM or WeetFeet instead....",
"__label__2 GREAT quality, powerful clipper: I have thick hair, and have been cutting it myself, with store-bought clippers, for years. During a recent use, my clipper choked on the thick hair, and I decided to get a professional clipper, so I bought the Oster Classic 76.What a difference! As you might expect based on the price, the Oster is in a class above when compared to the clipper kits you buy at the local Rite-Aid or WalMart. It's a quality appliance and seems to be well worth the extra expense for regular clipper users.So, why 4 stars instead of 5? Two reasons. One, it doesn't come with the numbered plastic combs--you have to purchase them separately. Second, it's on the heavy side and it's a bit cumbersome to use compared to the lighter, cheaper models. I suppose that's the price you pay for quality.",
"__label__2 Great Film, If You Don't Think About It: Frequency is a movie that entertains, thrills, and stimulates, but all that can be ruined if you think too much about it. Dennis Quaid plays Frank Sullivan, a firefighter killed in a fire in 1969. Thirty years later, his son, John (played by James Caviezel), finds his father's old ham radio. Through the miracle of the Aurora Borealis (how many of THOSE do you see in New York?), they manage to talk to each other through the ages. Through this communication, John saves his father's life, but he changes history so that a famous murderer is back on the lam, and he is going to kill John's wife. So far, so good. But soon after, inconsistencies pop up. All in all however, this movie is a fine story that was short-changed in the theatres. I would recommend it to anybody who likes these kind of cross-time magical movies.",
"__label__2 Like All of Oates' Books, This One is Incredibly Haunting: This is an incredibly haunting book. It examines the complexinteractions and experiences that go into creating our coreselves.Iris Courtney grows up in an emotionally impoverished and al-coholic home where chaos looms in the wake of her mother'sdrinking. Iris yearns for love and touch but her mother'sdistance causes irrevocable pain, dissociation, and fuge-likestates that become Iris's primary coping skills.Eary in the book, Iris becomes fatefully tied to a young blackman who innocently kills a boy who has been tormenting Iris.Their lives become forever connected as they maintain the se-cret of the killing forever.",
__label__2 Good Book: The book was overall pretty good. It's not very intriguing but motivational nonetheless. I would recommend it to those who enjoy inspirational type things.,
"__label__2 Useful tool for the classroom: Other colleagues of mine have these chimes in their classrooms. I've been wanting to get one and I found this one which is very affordable. I do wish I had purchased the multi-chimes rather than the single one, though. It sounds nice but now I realize I would have liked a few sounds instead of just the one.",
"__label__2 Above grade: Very good horror flic. But the DVD ending left me puzzled. Turn out the lights, you'll be rewarded.",
"__label__2 Praise for International Marionettes: I liked the fact the book was written by an ex employee of a major corporation in a manner that related the true feelings that many management employees experience, but do not have the courage to talk about, much less write about. It brings home the job pressures and the need to continually perform and improve. It also clearly outlines what lengths the corporate world will go to to maintain control.The author is to be saluted for having the backbone to fight back and to stand for principle. Most of all it is a story of his tenacity and need to persist and to get answers. Several of the chapters deal with the author's dark side and indiscretions which add flavor, but cause one to say ""why did he do that?""",
"__label__2 A Compelling Read: Ann Patchett has an amazing way with words - she sculpts characters that are more than 3 dimensional. This is a love story, but is it romantic love, love of life, love of art? All three, I think. I didn't get swept up into this book quite as much as the Magician's Assistant, but I still recommend it. It is a very unique story, with totally lovable characters. I missed them when I was done reading the book! Enjoy!",
"__label__2 MISS WILSON NEVER MISSES: Miss Wilson is my favorite singer -- there are no exceptions -- so if you're looking for critical words you can stop right here. On this album she puts her unique style and charm to several new tunes (my favorite is ""Knitting Class"") but most stellar is her version of ""Taking a Chance on Love,"" on which she makes the most of her lower register (which has always been stellar and wonderful). This song, and some others on recent CDs, are from the ""old school,"" as if Miss Wilson FINALLY decided to sing some of the stand-bys, as if clearing up some old ""to do"" lists. We are the beneficiaries. I'm grateful she continues to record, but I miss very much her live performances.",
"__label__2 Welcome to Our World... On The Other Side...: Although our man Jerry has left us, this album is reminiscent of all that is true to his legacy. He may not be in the band in person, but in spirit... you can agree that they kept with all tradition of JG. There will never be a substitute for Jerry, but regardless of personal feelings, this band will always be part of the DEAD HEAD CLAN. Be True!VIVA LA JERRY! Keep His Spirit Alive... Forever!",
"__label__1 Dont drop it!!: This is the most fragile CD player I have ever seen. I went through !4! of these CD players and each of them broke when I dropped them once or twice. These werent big drops, 3 feet max. It has reading problems where for no reason it would say ""read error"" (this happens even before you ""break"" it). It was great having 180 songs on one CD, but replacing it so often is not worth it. I reccomend the sony line of CD players (they have a mp-cd player too), that line can really take a beating.",
"__label__2 Amazing: When I was younger I had the casette recording of this album. I listened to it so many times I actually wore the tape so thin you could hear both sides (A and B) at the same time. I've been looking at second hand shops for this album ever since, I never imagined it was still being made. Every single song on this album is bound to become a family favorite. Just because songs are safe for kids to listen to doesn't mean they have no use for adults. There are some beautiful love songs on this album. Stereotypical children's songs get old fast. How many times can you listen to twinkle twinkle little star and the alphabet song before going crazy because they're the same tune? These songs will give a much needed burst of color into your child's music collection.",
"__label__1 Hercules or Xena, with a ""Sword of Truth"" world slapped on.: Firstly, I loved Sam Raimi when he made Hercules and Xena. They were campy, and so fun to watch. The problem was, you never took them seriously. Now, imagine one of the best fantasy series every written, and then make it Hercules. It is painfully obvious that Sam Raimi never read more than perhaps the back cover of the book. It seems that they took his name from Spider-Man, and used that prestige and high budget to make the show.The cast (aside from Zed) seems like they were picked from the phone book. Richard, rather than a tall, built D'Haran man, he is a small, skinny guy. Ever woman in the midlands has hair just as long as Kahlan's, and Darken Rahl isn't even blonde! While i'm positive that those who loved Hercules or Xena will enjoy this show, anyone who has ever read any of the books will want to sandpaper their eyes. I wish I could give this 0 stars.",
"__label__1 I don't remember asking for Linear: Snow White & The HuntsmanIs it my imagination or are we now entering into a phase where all movie genres are reduced to a ""Police Procedural"" format? Linear, step by step reenactments of each other? Because at some point I was under the impression that ""plot points"" were united with character development in such a way that we, humble supplicants all -- actually enjoyed or cared about the characters or felt a connection to the back story or (on seemingly rare occasions) both. This was a tragic waste of talent and while you could point to the subject matter and say, as a viewer I'm demanding too much complexity -- and all I'd be able to say is, ""Yeah, but other people seem to be able to do it successfully. Better luck next time.",
"__label__2 An example of the best: Star Wars, the world within our own, has been an escape and a fantasy for people around the world for 25 years. With the new prequels, a new breed of genius has taken the visual cues from Episode 1 and have developed an evolving world that leads into the dismal grey world of the original trilogy. Lead Art Director Doug Chiang, Ian McCaig, Jay Shuster, Ed Natividad, Ryan Church, Eric Tiemens and others bring together visual assault and appropriate culture cues to develop a wide array of designs and illustrations for Episode 2. If you are an artist, or are interested in the production level of film artistry, then this is a must have book. From the magnificent simplicity of the vehicle designs, to the flowing, organic genius of the character designs, this culmination of artwork is a glimpse into the world we continue to love and grow with.",

I can't imagine what kind of woman would enjoy and give a good review to a book where the heroine was raped. And, yes, it was rape no matter what flowery term you put it in. Neither the ""hero"" in the book is unlikable and selfish. And later in the book, you find the heroine's first husband, who happens to be the brother of the hero, turns out to have had an affair with a girl while the heroine was waiting for him to return to her in France. There is not a redeemable character in this entire book. This book is a disgrace to women and not worth the paper it's written on.",
__label__1 PollyAnnaEducation: Mr Wong is making a good living selling his book and working the lecture circut. Some good ideas but a lot of impractical stuff included. The reality of the classroom and the ineffectiveness of school administration make working under such ideal circumstances unrealistic.

Well - it does exist on DVD, on the compilation DVD ""Mickey's Magical Christmas - Snowed in at the House of Mouse (1983)"" - which is available here at Amazon. Only flaw - and a big one in my opinion - is the intro which has been cut from the VHS version. It starts right into the movie, with the panning down into the city, and the only bit of the wonderful intro song is a short verse at the end. Maybe most people won't mind, but having seen the VHS every christmas for several years, it's a shame really. But the entire movie is there unedited. I hope the whole thing with the intro and all is on the next ""Walt Disney Treasures - Mickey Mouse in Living Color Part 2"" available next year...",

This is great for storing a portable CD player. I don't know how well it works for DVD players which are usually a bit larger, but it works good for my portable CD player.This reminds me of a miniature version of the padded laptop computer bags.

I mean the Reason why I said this is better than The Playstation Portible (Sony's 1st handheld system) because Sony doesn't know what the heck there making I mean Nintendo made more Games for the DS than Sony because Sony is making a little bit of Games for the PSP but I betcha the DS is going to be better.,

"__label__1 A fruity foursome strikes again.: To start things off with, this album deserves negative stars. After listening to this album countless times, I came to the conclusion that this is the sort of music that I might think that pirates would listen to.

It's time for this fatuous foursome of the seven seas to try something new in life like treasure hunting or shoe shining, but not making another appearance to the studio but to produce nothing but balderdash.",
"__label__1 This is the second year in a row my tree has fallen over: Beware of this stand. I bought one several years ago (not sure if it was the same brand, but looks exactly the same and I paid about the same price) at a big name home improvement store and it was great as long as my tree wasn't over 5 1/2 feet. Even with the two level screw system it is difficult to keep a larger tree - say, anything 6 feet and up, from tilting in the stand. I noticed over the past couple of days the tree leaning ever so slightly, and this evening, CRASH there it went. The tree didn't come out of the stand, the whole stand tipped over with it. The stand has a wide base, but something is missing, maybe it's too short or something. I wouldn't recommend this stand if you'd like your tree to stay upright.",

"__label__2 CD COMES WITH THE BEST MUSIC VIDEO MADONNA HAS EVER DONE: Hi. I gave this single 5 stars, not for the remixes, but for the wonderful music video that comes with it. When she came out with the song I was disapoineted that the video didn't come out on dvd like ""Music"" or ""What it feels like for a girl"", but when I slid the cd into my computer (to play the songs) I was pleasently suprised to see the music video pop up! It is so cool to watch madonna dance around in the sand with her cow-girl hat on and cow-boy boots. This is one of her best songs and in my opinion it is her best video. When you put it in your computer it comes up just as clear as a DVD would be. It comes in as a full screen!!!! As far as the remixes go, they are are pretty good. I prefer the original version, but when I found out this cool music video was on the compact disk, I bought it on the spot! You better add this to your wish list... FAST!",

If you want to blow some money on 22 minutes of the worst martial arts demonstations and questionable interpretations ~ buy this. If, on the other hand, you really want to learn martial arts, or want a deeper understanding ~ DON'T BUY THIS. I doubt any of the black belts in this video ever did bunkai or their kata performance would be above yellow belt techniques. Some of the comments by the speaker, such as they don't do shime during Sanchin because of ""liabilities,"" makes you ask what other excuses and fantasy they created. In short, it's simply the biggest crock of horse manure one could pack into one DVD. If it was possible to give negative 100 stars, this would be the first candidate to come to mind.

I know this because I was responsible for the artwork. It's a pity that so-called reveiwers are so ignorant and loud-mouthed without having the knowledge or intelligence needed to make comment.,

The thing you don't find out until you have this in your hand is that that pretty stainless rim has an overhang on the inside. The result is that when you turn the strainer over to rinse out whatever you strained out, that material lodges in the overhang and is essentially impossible to clean out. I have only the 12.25"" size, but I'm guessing all the sizes in this line have the same problem. If you want a strainer as a kitchen decoration, then buy this.

"__label__1 Predictable: I really like these kinds of romance novels. Particularly novels set in Scottland, which was why I bought this book. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to my expectations at all. It was incredibly predictable and I felt, written poorly. So much so, that I stopped reading it mid-way through the book. I almost never, ever do that as most times I want to finish the book to see if it either gets better, or see how it ends. This book also seemed insulting to women in general as it goes on and on about how much the young woman in the story talks; as if women can't help but ""blather on about things."" I probably won't buy another Kinley MacGregor novel after this. I hate to spend the money and be totally dissatisfied.",

The book explains the concepts of using topo maps. But does very little to teach you how to use them!!

I leased this second DVR for other household members and found it impossible to program and quite clumsy in operation. Why do I need to push the guide button twice just to see the channel guide?

I tried the other ones only to find out that they won't play either.

The characters are lovingly and carefully crafted as is the story. the tale of a young Chinese man who is sent to a small village in Japan to recover.

A simple sentence, wanting to grow, to complexify, its predicate demanding its object --- give it its object. Your mouth. And I opened my mouth, and he pulled my head down on him, hard.

"__label__2 Excellent covering many influenced regions around the world: This in an excellent cookbook that traces Indian influences around the world. It has loads of interesting and exotic recipes and also has many of the much loved standard dishes found Indian influenced areas around the world, including surprising places such as Kenya. The initial history of the Indian influences is fascinating. There are even recipes for creating 19th century ""British"" style curries and different curry powder recipes. It's a great cookbook for both someone getting into cooking this style of food or for someone already with lots of different cookbooks seeking something new and interesting.",
"__label__1 Clash of the Comic Titans: The legendary teaming of W.C. Fields and Mae West has some hilarious moments, but does not make for classic cinema. ""My Little Chickadee"" (1940) is an unsuccessful patchwork of two comedic styles that simply do not mesh. In fact, the Western satire works best when the stars keep their distance by doing their own thing. Not surprisingly, the film was more successful for Fields than for Miss West - who detested the Great Man until the day she died. Worth seeing for historical purposes.OVERALL RATING: **",

I guessed every step of the way...not really caring about these flat underdeveloped characters. When I was finished, my first question was ""Was it REALLY possible that with ALL the authorities from many organizations working on the case (going through his belongings AND seizing his computer?)....the Pilots Wife unravels it all herself first? AND...after the short period from the time of the tragedy to the completion of the book...the author found that to be enough time to end the book with Kathryn actually caring about Muire's children?

I am not normally one who likes the first person narrative but Hobb masters the technique. The magic in this series is original and intreging. Book one and two were excellent, the third book drags alittle and the ending left me feeling slightly cheated but over all these three books that any fantasy fan will enjoy.",

Their efforts to share memories and look to the future through favorite recipes was valiant.But they deserved better than the rest of this book, which was repetitive and simplistic.

They either should not have written anything, or they should have done a more substantial job with what they did write.",

It's hard not to ape Rick's guitar playing when ""I've Done Everything For You"" is blaring, trust me. To summarize, buy it for a loved one today!",

George Lucas destroyed this beloved series when he redid the effects and altered scenes. You never, never, NEVER mess with a classic. My advice, don't bother with this DVD set. Stick with the VHS tapes you bought before Lucas went insane. Maybe the low sales of the DVDs will persuade Lucas to release the original versions on DVD.",

She stayed on it for 12 hours straight. It took two days before our other pup even got a chance to try it out. Now I'm ordering a larger one for him.

"__label__1 Radiation Hormesis - a one sided view: I was very disappointed in this unbalanced view the author presented. It fails to present supporting information that refutes the concept of radiation hormesis. Many of the examples presented as hormesis are actually stress induced changes that may reduce the overall fitness of the organism. For example, the ecologic radon studies of Bernard Cohen which are stated to support hormesis have been shown by Drs. R. William Field and Jay Lubin to be without merit. However, I did find some of the writing heuristic.",

When Juanito reaches school age, his parents settle down so that he may regularly attend. At first the new schedules feel strange to Juanito and he is often doing the wrong thing during designated times. However, once he adjusts, he discovers his beautiful singing voice, artistic talent, and receives high marks for a poem he wrote. He and his parents are proud of the success Juanito finds in school despite the challenge of adapting to an unfamiliar language and culture. The vibrant illustrations promote the positive feeling towords multiculturalism portrayed in this picture storybook.",

RPM was an enjoyable little diddy, but as soon as they found out they'd make more money with that poppy acoustic rock, they got on their knees to make the audiences happy. Although the CD is okay, it's too poppy for me. The best treat is by far the song ""Stay On"" with Nick Hexum, frontman of the band 311. Many people fail to realize Hexum's vocals on this though, therefore it will be skipped. Overall, this should appeal to all the bubblegum pop fans, as well as the blink 182 teenyboppers out there.Music fans can pass on this one though, you've heard it before.",

Unfortunately the padding around the handles is paper thin and the handles themselves are rectangular, not round. Thus creating a very non-ergonomic, awkward, and painful grip. Additionally, they provide virtually no height benefit as they barely raise you above the floor. The base is very narrow, prohibiting you from safely doing a wide stance push-up.

The writing is interesting and not full of boring technical jargan. This book is an excelent jumping off point for a time period or to get an overview of architecture in general. There is so much information one could get bogged down in, especially in the past century of architecture, but Wodehouse and Moffett charge on ahead without becoming stuck.

"__label__2 Amazing game!: I am not a gamer at all, but my husband got addicted to this game and insisted I try it. It is really a fun game! The programmers who made it must be tops in their field because there are very few glitches or bugs and the game-play is very intuitive. The detail is just amazing - from stars in the sky to footprints on the ground, they haven't left out any little thing. You really become part of this imaginary world.Even though a large part of this game involves killing members of the other faction as well as various other computer-generated beasts, this is not a mean-spirited game. It's difficult to be successful unless you team up with others and cooperate. I have seen a lot of very altruistic, helpful, and generous behavior from other players. There are always a few dorks around, too, of course, but for the most part this game seems to bring out the chivalry in its players. I'd recommend this game for age 13 and up.",

This is some of Sandler's best work yet.The Hell costumes and sets were fabulous, and I thought that it was remarkable that Adam could keep his face in that weird position for such a long time.I also found that Little Nicky, and an Adam Sandler character from SNL (Gil Graham) share many traits. If you have ever seen this character then you'll know what I mean.Overall, this is a HILARIOUS movie, and I highly reccomend that you rent/purchase it!:-D",

It seamlessly combines the sounds and rhythms of Africa, the Carribean, and Latin America with (a bit of) hip-hop, spoken word, and some serious jazz. The conscious message and tight rhythms and melodies of tracks like Spritual War, Broken Branches, Be Natural, and Misguided Warriors are incredible.

I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to really get done with cooking in 30 minutes or those wanting to eat healthy. None of the recipes are healthy. Cutting corners using processed foods is hardly healthy.,

If you want the drive for use outside your private network then you WILL need the software. Otherwise, there are a lot of sour grapes out there that do not know how to find a network drive. Word to the wise, the first time we put the drive on the network we had to turn the power off and turn it back on since it didn't get assigned an IP address on the router. So this method may be the trick you need to SEE it on the network. Enjoy a great home solution to networking.",

I also have on good authority that the book was rushed to press so it wasn't reviewed very carefully. The exams on the included cd are pathetic. Save your money, read the documentation for the PIX.",
"__label__2 Love it: Loved the book from beginning to end. Anyone can relate to the stories that the character goes through. Very descriptive of people, customs, places, and the culture of the people groups. Clean fun, nothing raunchy; all truth, but told in good taste. You can get the feeling that you were there, and makes you want more.",
"__label__2 A Very Complete Companion: The Greenhouse Gardener's Companion is a very thorough guide. The order of chapters makes sense - well thought out, and is a pretty darn good read. The author does not seem full of himself. It can be both humorous and thought provoking.",
"__label__1 Dreadful Book - Avoid: I haven't taken the exam yet, so I can't comment on the appropriatness of the book to the exam, but my biggest gripe is the ridiculous number of errors in this book. Even with the official list of errata at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;830785, I've lost count of the number of additional errors. If you do the exercises and think ""why isn't this working?"", you've hit yet another error. My advice: demand a refund immediately.",

"__label__2 Great Tactical Knife: The knife in 4"" version is just right for concealed carry, and it comes razor sharp. The quick open technic when removing from a front pocket is even easier and faster than an illegal switch blade. Your going to like this knife! Well built, solid with zero play in bolsters. Locks up quick and tight. I was impressed, the knife was on sale for $39.00 when I bought it. True value for the quality of the product. I would buy another and recommend to a friend. This was my first Cold Steel knife. I read the rave reviews first and I concur totally. It's a keeper!",
__label__1 Badly written tripe: If you're looking for a book that explores the true character of Martha Jefferson and her relationship with her husband...THEN DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. I can only assume that the other glowing reviews on this page were posted by the author's family. This book is not history--but romance- and it's not even well-written. Anyone associated with this thing should be embarrassed.,
"__label__1 Left me wanting: I just finished True Believer and I am so glad that I got this from the library, rather than purchasing it.It makes for an enjoyable read, but it seemed rather shallow & superficial. I must admit, I have never read any of Sparks novels before, but I have seen the movies Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. Both were excellent, so I had high hopes for this book.It wasn't that the book was bad, it was just I almost felt cheated regarding the main story of the book (mysterious lights in a cemetery).All in all it flows very well, but the writing style seems more in the order of a made for TV movie than a serious work of fiction.Of course, that's just my opinion--then again, I could be wrong.",
"__label__2 Brilliant!: I love this band. More than 5 years (since Cantoney), but Sinn Licht was a real shock for me. Murky atmospheres, fine female voice, a lot of modern neo-folk tricks and medieval feelings... It's my choice... for now. All the best in neo-folk is coming from Germany I think... Corvus Corax, Fiddler's Green - and Merlons, of course!",
"__label__2 Great machine with a couple of suggestions: The Oregon 88-023 does an absolutely beautiful job of grinding blades effortlessly. Should have purchased one years ago. I highly recommend it. However, WHY did they not include a second Table Plate? The cost would have been negligible. When switching from left-handed to a right-handed blade one must detach this plate and move it to the other side of the grinder. Also, braces on the hood as in similar models, would be nice, as it tends to vibrate/oscillate during operation.",

Nope. Stupid motor is crapping out. Could pay $35 for a new motor on their site but it would most likely die with the same problem. Tried the WD40 fix, but it only worked for 10 minutes before displaying the ""HO7"" error again. I'll try one more time, then I'll be forced to buy a quality player(meaning not from Panasonic.)And now my Panasonic TV is having issues with the RCA inputs.Thanks Panasonic!",
"__label__1 This book was obviously rushed thru the press....: I purchased this book as a suppliment to my Cisco ICRC and ACRC class materials. As I began to read this book, the errors were easy to find. Stay with the course materials from the classes. The book makes to many errors to rely upon as a study guide for the exam. As I took the Cisco ACRC class, I was able to find way to many mistakes in this book. Unlike Mr. Know-it-all from LA, I don't claim to know it all, as nobody does. But you don't have to be a genious to see the errors in this one.",
"__label__1 Don't Waste the Money: What a waste. The graphics are excellent but the story is horrible, not to mention the boards. I am definitely not a devout gamer, my last system was a Genesis, and bought this game out of nostalgia for the old Sonic. Most boards require nothing more than moving Sonic ""forward"", others, like a pitiful Casino Land, require playing pinball with games with bad physics and all but impossible to lose (I had to just let Sonic fall between the flippers). Don't waste the money, buy NFL2k instead.",
"__label__2 trotters and pacers: Another wonderful book from Marguerite Henry, this one tells 2 stories in one, which is a very unusual structure for her. I loved this book as a kid and was looking for a new copy. If you look at the images, you'll see the 2 different covers for this book, the original, by Wesley Dennis, shows a trotter - the new image for the cover, by a different artist, shows a pacer. This gait, while used by Standardbred horses, is very different than a trot. That's sort of like putting a football player on the cover of a baseball hitting manual! It's sad that the people who now publish her works don't seem to know what the books are about!Luckily the text is still right, and the story still wonderful.",
__label__1 Sound?: I did not like this movie. For some reason all I could hear was music. No words. I could have lived with it if there were captions.

"__label__2 Kampy, Klever, sooooo Kool: After the first viewing you will say wow! that film was interesting but could have been so much more. This really doesn't matter. After the second viewing you will understand what the filmmakers were going for and how they succeded on every level. It could be remade, but it would probably lose much of its low budget charm and freshness. The cast is only marginally good but it's not a variable. The film plays like a nightmare and is a perfect addition to MGM's Midnite Movie collection because it is best viewed in the later kult hours. You might just walk away unsure about clowns and their motives. What a fresh concept. Thank you Chiodo Brothers!",

I have been cosluting for many years, the last ten or so from a home office. This is not an easy transition and I found the toolkit helpful in many ways.It would have been extremely useful had I had it when I started out many years ago. Useful when I made the change to a home office and I found it still full of useful things after 35 years in the business.For the consultant that operates alone this book should be on the reference shelf.(after it has been read of course!)Murray Harvey",

"__label__1 Don't Spend Your Christmas With the Kranks: How sad it is, when a beauty of a book (Skipping Christmas) by an acclaimed author (John Grisham) is turned into a mess of a movie, it's only purpose being to rob hard-working people of their well-earned money. In watching this, I realized only one thing: Jamie Lee Curtis is getting old. She has gray hair. When did this happen?! This is a great example of a movie straining too hard to be funny. I felt like the Botox scene dragged on too long, and it was in the trailer so if you've seen the trailer you've seen basically that whole scene. Just don't waste your time or money, it's not worth it at all! If you're looking for a good Christmas movie for your family, try A Christmas Carol, A Christmas Story, (catch it anytime of the day you like Christmas day) or It's a Wonderful Life. And remember: It will be a Merry Christmas just as long as you don't spend it with the Kranks! Happy Holidays. Please rate if this review was helpful to you! Thanks!!",
__label__1 Pet-A-Roo Pet Carrier: This Pet Carrier will not hold any pet up to 20 lbs as stated in the product description. I have a small puppy that is 5 lbs and it is still too small for her. She barely fits in. I would say it is more for a pet weighing up to 3 lbs and no more then that.,
"__label__1 Real pig in a poke: What a waste of good money. Stick to the tried and true sensible approaches to healthy living. Not only is this impossible but probably very unhealthy. The advertising makes it sound so real and even says that you can eat ice cream, cheese, bread etc. How do these people sleep at night, and why have we become so desperate as to be suckered in?",

Alyss is actually a princess from wonderland and Redd (the red Queen) is her aunt . Dont want to go into to much details as it will spoil the story and I hate to do that! It does have some parts with violence so if a child is sensitive to that stuff you might want to read the book first! The first three quarters of the book does jump around from Alyss/Alice,Dodge,Hatter Madigan,and Redd but I did not find it difficult to keep it straight! I could not put this book down and now am getting ready to start book two Seeing Redd !",

"__label__2 It&#65533;s in the Bag: This book is a must have for handbag connoisseurs and girlie-girls. Beginning with the super-chic, boldly colored hot pink cover featuring a Louis Vuitton Damier bag, the book is beautifully illustrated with examples of the full spectrum of 20th century handbags from vintage Hermes to Kate Spade canvas to exotic art pieces. The text is comprehensive and intelligent, highlighting the origins and evolution of the purse, yet it is entertaining as well and never too staid. The book has a sense of humor.Readers will learn the history of Gucci, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Coach, and learn about memorable bags such as the Kelly bag named for Grace Kelly. It's a handbag lover's dream book.",

"__label__2 One of the best albums ever made.: First and foremost this is an innovative concept. 12 tracks has been portrayed as 12 dances with God(!) and name of the tracks are the name of the places (where the dances with God happens). This is an all instrumental suite from the master of flute, 'Jethro Tull' frontman Ian Anderson. The music is top notch, qualitywise comparable to any record produced ever. This a mixture of Jethro Tull kind of music and western classical with a little touch of Indian Classical music (In The Times Of India). Basically flute and fully instrumental.If you like Jethro Tull and/or Western Classical, you will be liking this. It is definitely the most underrated album on earth and one of the best albums I listened. So buy it to experience somrthing great.",

"__label__1 Really ugly baggy sweaters: I bought this book sight unseen because I like ""The Knit Stitch"" so much.

If anyone could explain to me how they are classified as rap/hip hop it would be greatly appreciated.... They should be under the genre of either Funk or Childrens Music! This cd sucks just as much as their other ones.... actually it is probably their worst album to date. They have 3 songs that are good out of all their albums.... Rosa Parks, B.O.B., and Ms. Jackson...so just download them or dont get them at all..... Worst album i ever heard!!!",

__label__2 VHS = 5 stars - DVD = 1 star: This 1991 concert is excellent with the best lineup since the original band (69-71) were all around and making great music. Warren Haynes makes for an excellent 2nd lead guitar with Dickey Betts and the band plays many of their classic tunes including extended versions of Elizabeth Reed and Jessica. don't buy the dvd as the editing is awful - but do get the vhs for all the uncut tunes.,

The plan is to bore a hole in the middle to place the periscope so they can see outside from inside the box. Sounds fun? Not exactly. The view is too small. When you look into it, you can only see an area the size of a single face in it. They should make this wide angle view. It is too hard to find and see anything, like looking for a tiny airplane up in the sky using a peephole. Not really worth it.Construction is fine. It is a piece of telescoping plastic pipe than extends to 14"". But at least it would help if it is more functional than this.",

"__label__1 Sanctimonious posturing: Christopher Hitchen's book ""No One Left To Lie To"" could have been great. I've always enjoyed his entertaining style and trenchant analysis in Vanity Fair. This book, however, is a huge disappointment. There may be insightful commentary buried in here, but it is under literally bucketfuls of invective, name-dropping, and self-aggrandizing. Hitchens clearly lacks emotional distance from his subject and he comes off petulent and mean-spirited. While this book is quite short, the reading of it was as arduous a process as picking up War and Peace in the original Russian. NOT recommended.",
"__label__2 Can I get a sixth star?: Guys, this is THE hub. In a world where USB hubs flop around under the desk at the mercy of their own cables, this one is like a piece of machined billet aluminum. You either tape or screw the base to your desk, then slide the hub on. It's now fixed in place. It comes with a mini-USB to USB cable to connect it to your computer. Then there are 7 more full-size USB sockets, 3 on one side, four on the other. The blue LED ""eye"" is nice but not obtrusive. A lovely metallic jewel in a crowd of junky plastic.

"__label__2 The name says it all: Joe Pernice is definitely one of the best songwriters alive today. Yours, Mine & Ours is another great album in his catalog (could even be the best, although I will see how it stands the test of time). From the first listen, you know you must own this album. The opening track, Weakest Shade of Blue, is reminiscent of many songs Joe has penned before, except he is now allowing little rays of happiness creep into his music...and the fun does not end there. As with most of Joe's albums, there is not a bad song anywhere to be found and it leaves struggling amature musicians, like myself, wondering how it comes so effortlessly for Joe. For fans, you already have this..but for newbies to the Pernice world, or anyone else interested in good, pure songrwriting...pick this one up.

I wear a 9 or 9.5 in women's shoes and the Large fits perfectly. I tried on an extra large in a store (since that's in line with my normal sizing) and there was a lot of extra space in the back fo the sandal. I'd say you don't need to get XL unless you wear a 10 or above.,

Might I suggest that 'Sue D'eauymme, 'Steven Spielberg' et al seem to have the making of great comedy screenwriters? It would be interesting if any of their scripts ever came across Jennifer Lerch's desk!The book, incidentally, is a rather average concoction which borrows heavily from other volumes and seems to revel in stating the obvious.

Buffy returns from the grave and starts a compelling and believable relationship with Spike (In his best season). The three nerds are the best villians in the series in my mind, they are hilarious. Spike interigating them with a Boba Fett action figure is priceless, as is the Millenium Falcon painted on the side of their covert ops van (With a horn that plays the Star Wars theme). Buy this season for the brilliant musical episode, ""Once More, With Feeling"" and stay for the evil Willow story arc which ends the season. A must have for all fans and another good starting place for newbies.",

"__label__1 Why so long???????: First, the book was so long, and he never stops describing the characters, towns, villages and other various items untill it's been blown way out of perportion. And next, too many twisting subplots to follow. He writes on one untill some actuall action happens(about 300 pages later), then in the middle of the action, he starts on one that no one can even remember. Ironic, isn't it. At the rate he's writing, hell be dead before the series is finished, and if he isn't, who will care about the climactic finish of him against the Dark One. I certainly won't. The story seams to be getting more and more subplots, without tying any of them off. The first few books were colorful, but then the passion is suddenly gone, with olny one book.",
"__label__1 Expecting More: If you've already got a pretty good handle on your divorce or separation, skip this book. I was expecting to discuss how to use my divorce as a springboard for an authentic, self -actualized life; instead I got lessons in how to put myself in my spouse's shoes, and other words of advice useful in salvaging what's left of the relationship with my spouse. I've done that work, I've agononized over this decision and see my present/future relationship with my spouse as business I have to attend to, in a professional way, as we raise our son. I'm past my spouse, and wish him nothing but the best as we continue to co-parent our son. Divorce will be the catalyst for my extraordinary life, but it will be a life I forge without the help of this book.",
"__label__1 Save your money. It's all in the manual.: Since I am a Filemaker beginner, I wanted a book to get me up to speed quickly. Filemaker comes with two manuals, a ""Getting Started"" guide and a ""User's Guide"". They are pretty good, but I was in a hurry and hoped that the Visual Quickstart Guide would live up to its title. Regretfully, the Visual Quickstart Guide merely rehashes the same information that is available in the User Guide. In most cases, I found the User Guide's explanations to be clearer than those in this book. The author seems to have forgotten a basic principle - a book on a software product must add value to the product's included documentation. I found Visual Quickstart guide to be worthless in that regard. Eventually, I gave up on it and simply used Filemaker's manuals.",

"__label__2 Great workbook on Neural Networks: I like this book very much. This workbook instructs one how to work through the mathematical requirements of neural networks. By doing so the reader gets a good mathematical background of chaining through the mathematics and seeing the internal structure of many networks. This information is valuable if one is interested in programming your own neural networks. The 5-1/2 floppy disk accompanying the workbook is not usable, at least not to me. If you need to learn and work through the mathematics and chart the results of neural networks that is a great book to start with.",

For years Lacey Bravo has had a secret love for Dr. Logan Severance, a man who is love with her sister. When Lacey's sister marries another man, she goes to Logan to offer some chocolate cake and a shoulder.......leads to a hot but brief affair. Nine months later Logan goes to Lacey and asks her to marry him. Lacey has taken off to her families cabin where she spends the time sketching, and missing Logan. Even though she loves Logan deeply she says ""No I won't marry a man that is love with my sister."" When Lacey gives birth, the baby begins to bring Lacey and Logan closer together, unwillingly, but irrevocably closer. A story that is emotional, intense and moving.",

Use a large pair of vice grips to close the crimper around the crimp ring connection and the connection is sealed. All of my crimps passed the Go/No-Go Gauge test the first time. My connections were crimped over 12 months ago and have had 190+ degree F water flowing through them ever since with zero leaks...can't say the same for my buddy who opted for plastic compression fittings, but we replaced his with copper crimp rings and he's had no problems since.

__label__2 great for sore/cracked nipples: sore/cracked nipples are very common on breastfeeding moms especially first time moms who doesn't have any clue about latching.1 oz might seems very less but it is good enough. Latching will get way better after the first 3-4 weeks and you might not need to use it afterwards. So there is no need to get a 5oz bottle.

You can still together shots for a 180 degree view, which is truly nifty, and it's got video capability and everything. On mine, however, the LCD screen proved vulnerable for reasons yet to be determined but depending on Kodak's response, I'm reserving judgement. These are awfully awfully nice cameras, tiny and high quality. I'd have a hard time getting anything else after this experience, even with the screen self destructing.ETA: and the kodak people were just wonderful, the camera was fixed, and I am happy all over again.ETA #2: The lenses are both digital, which means the camera's profile is flat all the time.

This song is absolutely sensual and the sexy voice of the singer lends it more than just a shade of wickedness.

Forde does a good job of structuring his book to allow entry into the complex and often counter intuitive thinking of the Theology of the Cross.I'd recommend this book to anyone who was seeking to gain entry into understanding the concepts of the Theology of the Cross, anyone who wanted a refresher course before diving deeper, or anyone who wanted to use it as a devotional guide.",

Simon was a kid that was different from everybody else and he always thought that God made him the way he was for a certain reason and he was right.

The book is boring and fast-paced, and it seems like Jane Leslie Conly has perhaps watered down the writing, perhaps to make it less difficult. The book got considerably better in the end, but still it was poorly written and boring. The plot was actually quite good, but the way everything went so quickly was confusing, and yes, I didn't like it. It was also too long for such a dull book. Usually I would think that 278 pages is short, but the way it drags on, it was a slow read for me. However, some parts were interesting, nevertheless, the first one was much better.

Like i said before if he were a Power Rangers Megazord i'd say nice homage to Optimus Prime and give it 5 stars, but sadly he's the real thing, and doesn't come close to being a ""transformer"" and only gets 1 star...yuck.",
"__label__2 Freeway 2 is similar to Freeway: On some of the reviews I have read on Freeway 2, some of the people do not see the connection with the first movie Freeway. I have seen both movies and like them both. Freeway is a modern and twisted version of the Little Red Riding Hood story. Freeway 2 is a very twisted version of the Hansel and Gretel story. That is the connection and why they both carry the same name even though the sequel doesn't have the same characters and a plot involving a freeway. I can't wait to see if there are more of the sequel upcoming.",
__label__1 So so aweful: This movie was dry and boring. It had very little story line and I had even less interest. That's sad because I enjoy Kevin Spacey's work and I enjoyed the music of the man as well. I shut the movie off after about 45 minutes of boredom.,
"__label__1 The packaging neglects to mention that this is propoganda: Pure blantant Christian propoganda. The acting is terrible, the story fails to argue its' point, and the packaging I would argue is intentionally deceitful, which is extremely ironcic given the Christian moral message of the movie.If you want another crutch to prop up your religious beliefs on, by all means rent this movie. But if you have a brain and can think for yourself, the ridiculousness of this movie will cease being funny about 30 minutes in.For the first 15 minutes I kept expecting the movie to be a joke, a comedy. But it isn't. Its just trite and stupid.",

It is a simple item made entirely of plastic (with nylon straps) and is as pictured.After sitting in the gear box unused a few times out for short trips, I tried to use the product. There was a leak in one of the basins at the bottom, rendering half of the item useless. The plastic doesn't stand up to the folding induced when the item is stored (as delivered).The construction is poor and the materials are the cheapest available. Given how the product is folded for storage it is inevitable that it will leak and soon.The cost was low, but seeing as I was not able to fully use it once before breaking, it doesn't matter.Don't buy this item.",

"__label__1 Unbelievably dull: The only people who could honestly say that they related to this static, dull and poorly written film are Japanese girls who've recently graduated high school.

How low will these people go?",

I've read every one as soon as I could get my hands on them, and reread each so many times I'm afraid I will have to replace the books soon from sheer wear and tear. Shirley is the non politically correct, common sense first opposite of every fluff headed ""heroine"" that clutter too many mysteries. The mysteries are clever and beguiling but it is the the people in the books I want to know more about. They are real, flawed, full flavored, and interesting. My only complaint is that Ms Oliphant cannot, under the present law, be forced to write more, more, more.",

I don't care what detailed reviews say (sure there are ways to disect the book). I don't care. It's just another very good book by Irving. So go read it. Worthy enough to splurge on the hardback to add to your library shelf. Maybe even with some spot lighting on it.,

"__label__1 A CD with more sincerity than true passion: This CD is neither horrible nor sublime. Just...OK. Mediocre. It's competent, but it has no lasting hold. The listenere coming to this CD looking for a great jazz CD will be sorely disappointed. Naylor obviously has a wonderful voice, smoky and sultry, and the musicianship throughout is quite good. And yet, there's something a little soulless about it all. The lyrics, while intending to be heartfelt and confessional, sound not unlike the heartfelt confessions of someone else--Sarah McLaughlin, Toni Childs, Jane Siberry, even Joni Mitchell. Nothing truly insightful or distinctive, beyond that wonderful voice. Which is a shame, because there's nothing ""wrong"" here, but it all ends up as so much melancholy cotton candy.I do think it's telling that the vast majority of the reviews below begin with raves about her live performances. Perhaps that's the way to see Naylor, with a drink in hand and a freshly broken heart.",

I have tried to force my way thru thinking it would get better. It never does. I tried over and over and over. It is so badly written I had to look at the page numbers to be sure it wasn't bound out of order. I think the other reviews were written by the authors mother and she never read it. GARBAGE !!!!!",
"__label__1 Not So Everlasting: I bought two of these treat balls for two large breed dogs. One, (my power chewer) is a German Shepherd/Wolf mix, the other is a Vizsla/lab mix who isn't easily impressed by chew toys. I filled the inside of the ball with small treats, and capped both ends with the round treats provided. On the upside when they were actively chewing on the treat balls, they were fully absorbed, and were extremely happy with them. In about an hour and a half both dogs had chewed the everlasting out of at least one side of each of their treat balls. By three hours there were no treats left in either of them. Since the ball itself seems pretty flimsy I then took the balls away so they wouldn't destroy those too. The treats give off a nauseating smell as the dogs are chewing them as well, to the point I had to turn on a fan, and even left the room. I wouldn't recommend this product due to the high price tag, and the fact that it just doesn't deliver on it's name.",
"__label__1 Not what it claims to be: When a publisher presents a book as being a work of history knowing that its author's research is suspect to say the least, I believe the consumer has every right to be upset about that.The problem with this book is not the occasional error or fact or misprint but that the author made claims to his qualifications and research that when checked turned out to be very questionable to say the least.It seems he was never a Lord as he claimed, nor ever a Baronet as he claimed, nor a PhD as he claimed. One asks oneself the question why somebody would need to make all these suspect claims if this book was really what it has been made out to be, namely a work of history.It is however a very good read. That is why I give it one star. It is entertaining. I only hope somebody writes a biography of its author one day (how's this for a title - ""The Man of Many Names"") as I am sure that will be even more entertaining.",

This unit is made in China and not sure what the species of wood is, but it is laminated with a lot (8) of knot defects in the wood. The indiivdual blocks that make up this organizer were out of alignment/crooked so that one of the large knife slots is unusable. Only 1 of the large knive slots was aligened with the end block.

"__label__1 Vintage recording..but mastered at the wrong speed!: This is indeed a vintage recording of George Carlin with Jack Burns when they used to be a team back in the early 60's. The material is very dated which is expected, and truthfully not that funny, and the recording quality is not too good.The most annoying thing about this release is it was mastered at the wrong speed. Yes, George and Jack were younger back then but WAY past the age of puberty so their voices were not THAT much higher!! I am fortunate to have heard an original copy of the album, so apon hearing this CD for the first time was a bit of a shock.The cover is a total joke as well. It shows Carlin in his later days which gives no indication of the vintage recording contained inside. This cd is only for the collector.(I bought a copy, re-mastered it and corrected the speed using Sound Forge, then made a beautiful cover using an appropriate picture of ""Burns & Carlin"")Now I have to find a way to unload the ""speeded up version""",
"__label__1 Disappointing static noise - bacon frying - high rating a mystery: I bought this based on the good review rating, however it is a mystery to me why this has been rated so well. Perhaps expectations are low for most people. For me it is unacceptable. During the non-loud moments (playing music or a phone call) you hear a very annoying static sound, similar to the sound of bacon frying. I have tried this on all three of our cars and the results are the same. If you crank up the music and the music selection has no quiet passages, the audio quality is barely acceptable.",

"__label__1 If you have a relationship with God and are set apart don't buy this book: Now, I must admit one night I was sitting watching television and I heard her ministering on TV about some things and she mentioned this book coming out. At that point I felt the Holy Spirit and thought it was so coincidental for me to see her right at that moment, because I NEVER watch television and so on and so forth. So, I jumped on-line and pre-ordered the book. I struggled to somewhere in the 2nd chapter and then put it to the side. There was no God or Holy Spirit ministering in that book. I either threw it away or gave it away. The sound of God is very distinct and if it wasn't in the 1st 2 chapters I wasn't wasting my time trying to find him in the rest of it. So, if you are anointed, set apart, prophetic, peculiar don't look to hear your fathers voice in this one. Sorry!",
"__label__1 A miserable attempt to give life to a great book: It's always been my personal belief that if you aren't going to stay true to a novel, then you shouldn't make a movie about it. This movie was in no way, shape, or form either The Vampire Lestat or The Queen of the Damned. It was a pathetic attempt to gather some actors together, have them hiss and bare their fangs, and play music. The producers should never have tried to make this movie. They have no concept of being true to a novel, of characterization, or even of the concept of a plot.",

Looking at the manufacturer's website, I find that this item can be adjusted to 20.5-25.5 inches high. Since the legs that go into the tub need to be shorter than those that go outside the tub, the transfer bench will be perhaps 22 inches off the floor when the bench is level. For many people, their legs will be hanging at this height or they will be sitting on the edge of the bench weight resting on their wet slippery feet. It's ridiculous that the supplier hasn't warned potential customers that this item is unusually large.In all other respects, this transfer bench seems perfect fine.

"__label__1 Chalk another one up for DOA: Like most of the other 1-stars here, this review is for Amazon's terrible packing and the apparent flimsiness of the product.

I returned it and received its replacement via next-day FedEx with the handle broken clean off. Aren't these things supposed to last decades? At this point, Amazon seems to want to cut its losses and refund my purchase price.ATTN: Amazon-- Maybe it's cheaper to spring for better packing materials than having to pay for return shipping and trashing tons of these skillets?Based on this product's noted propensity to break either during shipping or during use-- and in light of its notably skinny handle-- you may want to spring for thicker, slightly more expensive cast-iron cookware.",

__label__1 What a piece of Junk.: I would like to save you the trouble that I had to go through I buying the Schick Quattro razor.It was by far the worst shave I had ever had in my life. It did cut close but only after being dragged across my face four or five times. It wasn't worth two cents. It was very rough on my face and I don't even have a thick beard. All I did was irritate my face and cut myself.It is far better to buy cheap plastic disposables. No joke they work better than that piece of junk.I got one of my friends who didn't believe me to try it and he had the same opinion.,
"__label__1 I REALLY tried...: Maybe this just isn't the best introduction to McEwan...I just could NOT get into this book. Everyone I know has read and loved it, but I got the the third break in the writing, closed it, and had NO desire to pick it up again (so I haven't).My main question is: Isn't it a good idea to introduce the PLOT within a few chapters??? There's just a lot of detail for detail's sake...the first three chapters could have been summed up in about a sentance or two...maybe, ""He is an excellent doctor, and not the type you'd want programming the music at your parties"" would have sufficed?Maybe this one gets better...it's a shame that the opening bored me so much that I'll never find out.",
"__label__1 Very Bad Movie for Several Reasons: I bought this movie and must say I was deeply disturbed by the violent portral of the rape of the actress. Her face being kicked and punched to a pulp was utterly sick. I realize this must happen in real life, and I am truly sorry for women this happens to, I just don't need to see it in my home.Another feature of the film that made me almost seasick from the start was the camera technique of swirling the camera around and tilting it different directions. I guess if one is high on acid, this makes sense?This review is my own personal opinion and I don't expect anyone to be impressed, only hope to help some folks avoid wasting their money on a worthless movie.If I could return it, I would do so, I guess I will hang the CD in my garden to scare away the birds!Save your money and don't buy this worthless effort.

"__label__2 Portrait of an Artist: Perhaps one of the best collections of poetry ever assembled, Sylvia Plath's poems are a must read for Plath fans and poetry buffs alike. Listed in chronological order (as much as possible), readers should pay particular attention to the poems from the summer of 1962 until the last poems in 1963 to fully appreciate the groundbreaking, enigmatic verse that defines Sylvia Plath. In addition to fifty poems written during her years as an undergrad at Smith College, there is a very interesting selection of notes including the original order of poems in Plath's Ariel collection (the order of the posthumous collection was altered following her death). A wonderful gift for (literate) college students (and not just English majors).",

"__label__2 Fascinating search for the Fifth Man, true life intelligence: Story of British spies ~ MI5 in particular ~ from one who livedthrough it. Wright was the first scientist to join MI5, the domesticspy-catchers, and led the way for others. The bulk of the book is taken up with the search for the Fifth Man ~ Wright's candidate is Roger Hollis, who was head of MI5 during the early Sixties ~ a well-hidden Soviet mole like Philby and his ilk. Reading it, at times, it appears that Wright considers himself responsible for every innovation in spy technology during the '50s and '60s, but if you can get over his view of himself, the book becomes a fascinating read, on a par with anything Le Carr√© wrote. As far as the Fifth Man goes, my mind is still open, but Wright gives excellent cause to suspect that Hollis probably was at least bent, if not broken.",

"__label__2 Best way to a sunless tan: I've seen tanning sheets on the shopping channels but didn't believe they worked as easily as they said - WITHOUT STREAKING - until I tried the L'Oreal Towelettes. I've used the Sublime Bronze tinted self-tanning lotion for years, and these towellets are far superior since it's so much easier to smooth the tint all over, evenly and quickly, rather than tube-to-hand then hand-to-body. The color builds slowly over 2-3 applications but lasts about a week and fades fairly evenly, at least in my case. One towelette does indeed cover face, upper body and legs. Just clean your hands after application as with any tanner and even if a little too much color gets on elbows, knees, or something, it's easy to even out the color by rubbing with a damp facecloth. The price isn't bad considering the convenience.",

Now i think she went and slutted up her appearance as much as possible to sell cds. The photo of her on her solo cd looks like the coverbox of a porno movie. I don't think any of the hits off her new cd are remarkable at all. If the songs Crazy In Love and Baby Boy are supposedly the best songs on the cd then that's not saying much. Once again we have another example of an artist who used to be good as part of a group who went solo and came up with a big disappointment. Skip this one.,

Oh yeah, multiple assassins around every corner. A brilliant concept almost completely ruined by too much action and too many characters. It becomes completely overwhelming when the dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream, culminates in some sort of ""Ice Station Zebra(esque)"" nonsense. JEEZ--the audience needs a breather!DiCaprio's talents are completely wasted. The subplot with the dead wife was strangely reminiscent and done much better in ""Shutter Island."" Gordon-Levitt was miscast(way too young for the part). Ellen Page fares slightly better as the so-called ""dream architect.""Kudos for the awesome art direction and set design--I would bet my bottom dollar an Oscar or two is definetly in store.I really wanted to like this movie--but in an eggshell--it was just TOO MUCH.",

They don't give you layouts of cities like Ciudad Juarez, but you get a fat ol' book stuffed with information on the technologies, strategy, and culture of the NGR and Gargoyle Empire, with notes on the rest of the city.If you like big high-powered toys and high adventure, get this supplement and loose your PCs on some gargoyles and Brodkil. If you are more subtle, there are a lot of cool espionage or political possibilities in this book. But whatever you are, if you are a big Rifts fan, this is one of the best books you could get.",

I would be happy to use them for camping or at concerts. The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I just don't know how water resistant they are -- haven't been in the rain with them.

The fourth one they sent us just went to electronics heaven, after only three months.It won't even turn on. We aren't talking about giving this to a gorilla who abused it to death. We are talking about a sixteen year old who is very careful with her things. In my opinion, its just a piece of junk. It looks nice, sounds great,until it quits on you.It quits with no warning, just stops working. I've had cheap transistor radios that lasted longer! Also, be aware, they only warranty these things from the original purchase, so the latest piece of junk they sent us is no longer warrantied even though it is essentially brand new.Don't waste your money on this one.",

Ralph Fiennes does not seem to be ugly. In fact, he was more good looking. This is important because it is one of the reasons why he is messed up. His mom left him because of what he looked like and thus his grandma took care of him. That's why he still lives in his grandma's house.

Fortunately, Clay is the beacon of the light. A likable guy who seemed unable to commit, he found his love in Quinn. Yet again Schwahn decides to kill someone off, this being Haley and Quinn's mother. Yet again, Schwahn uses the plot line of a crazy stalker. Unfortunately, the character of Dan is not in much of the season. Attempts to be funny were made, such as the girls getting high of pot brownies. Attempts failed. Terrible season.

Antonio Tibaldi directs this story about a dysfunctional family and its secrets, particularly Jimmy`s past, AKA ""Little Boy Blue"" (played by Ryan Phillippe). Despite the mysterious tone of the film, which offers some surprises along the way, this is an average effort overall, since the pacing is too slow at parts and the ending isn`t too satisfying.

Unfortunately, the clips pretty much summed up the album, and when I stuck it into my stereo expecting more content than a few 30 second real audio samples could provide (which I usually get, even from albums I don't like) I was disapointed.

This is probably the best known of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and it it really deserves it's classic status. It is a gripping tale mixing crime investigation with a touch of the supernatural and is after 100 years still a page-turner. Arthur Conan Doyle helped start a genre that continues to entertain as evidenced by the countless crime novels and detective shows on TV. Despite the potential overexposure Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson still seem relevant and the deductive reasoning Holmes employs to solve the mystery of the Hound Of The Baskervilles is so entertaining that I read this in one day, unable to put it aside.

"__label__2 A predictable yet engrossing read: Anne Rice fans will find much that is familiar in ""Cry to Heaven"", although unlike her other popular novels, there is no element of the supernatural present here. This is a book that will transport the reader back to 18th century Italy, into a world of politics, intrigue, corruption, and most of all, music. Rice's writing is as full and rich as always, with detailed settings and fully realized characters. The novel is well-researched, I learned much about the time period that I didn't know before.The flaw? I found most of the major plot twists to be extremely predictable. I won't give anything away, but every time something shocking happened, I had already guessed what was to come at least a chapter before. Maybe I've just read too many books. Regardless, I would still recommend this book to any Anne Rice fan.",
"__label__2 GIVE DONNY OSMOND A BREAK!: This video was fabulous! But my main reason for writing this review is to tell people who are having concerns about the video because of Donny Osmond, GET A LIFE! Donny is no longer a 15 year old teen idol. Some people who still see him that way need to get out of the 70's. He has grown up into a fine performer. Give him a break. Everyone in the video was fantastic and it is definitely a must see.",
"__label__1 Unoriginal and disappointing: Unfortunately Miss Edyta let herself be lured by the world of cheesy tunes, wrote either for her or peformed by some other artists. I don't think she has much chance of conquering the Western markets with this unoriginal repertoire. For some reason her voice is not as excellent as it was the case on the earlier Polish record, 'Dotyk'. It seems to be dampened down, and lacks that unique 'colour' and variety we have heard before. The songs' monotonous tone definitely does not help her perfom to the best of her ability. Edyta, you can definitely do better!",

Ya, I liked the Beatles---with all their pretension---and all that, until I heard the Brothers D and then I realized that there is one man who figured it ALL out 30 years ago. I mean the reason rock intellectuals describe Ray Davies as a genius is beacuse he is!... The back to basics production and beautiful melodies make the Village Green essential listening! I just wish they'd make this album in closed caption, because then we'd all have world peace!",

So far he hasn't been able to use it. He called the number for help that was in the instructions. That rep gave him another number. Then the second rep gave him a third number to call. Then the third rep told him to ""go online"". My Dad is 74; he does not go online. So Sony has been no help. I live far away, so I can't look at the setup myself. I asked him questions, went online to find answers, asked him more questions. Finally figured out one of the problems is that the cable to connect the unit to his television is too large for the TV's line out, which is where it has to connect in order for both of my parents to hear the TV. Does anyone know if there is an adapter available? I dread calling Sony for this because I don't have all day to be on the phone.",

And of course the living kill of the remaining living humans with no guilt or further thought! Reminds me of ""the Dawn of the Dead"" when a scientist teaches a zombie to behave. I found Flynn and his lunatic opposite both due a double tap to the brain. Just dumb. Oh and the sceanery of an island off Delaware doesn't have mountains in the background... The whole film was disjointed and pathetic...I love zoombie films but they have to havea plot; this film was made to make money off the Romero name and prior great zoombie films. Sorry George.",

"__label__1 Great premise, poor execution: I don't get it. Is it true that a book written like a high school creative writing project can get suchgreat reviews, based only on its thought-provoking premise? It seems so. Yes, the Truth Machine isa great idea. Yes, it would change the world, perhaps even more than Mr. Halperin postulates. But,this work of ""speculative fiction"" falls a bit short of impressive on the storytelling front. Thecharacters are one-dimensional, the plot contrived and predictable, and the dialogue wooden. As apremise for a story, it's great: recommended. As a story: read Heinlein. You won't be disappointed.",

You couldn't understand anything because there were spelling mistakes in every sentence. I also disliked the explanations in the book. They don't help you out at all when it was time to do the problems. Even the questions were filled with errors such as missing symbols, wrong numerical values (and the list goes on).

The volume of the station is not too great and you can't see yourself too well on the tv but what do you expect for a $50 kids ""toy"". It is nice because you can plug it into your tv and sing along with the songs and hear your voice coming out of the tv.

It's a little longer than the seat is, but that really posed no problem. Like all gel seat covers the gel moves around to conform to the shape of your butt and your movement. I replaced the old one, a different brand, because it had became lumpy and misshapen after a long period of time. So to prevent that with this new one I remove the cover about once a month or so, depending on use, then realign it back on the seat, to prevent the lumping. So far so good.",

"__label__2 Ahab's Bride: Ahab's Bride is captivating. Although I am not easily hooked into a novel, I was hooked almost before I could take a breath. I could hardly put the book down until I was finished.From the first paragraph the reader is transported back in time to 19th century Nantucket into the world of Moby Dick's Captain Ahab and the woman who falls love with him. With an impeccable depiction of the period, Louise M. Gouge walks us through the dusty streets of two whaling communities and into the lives of these fictional, but realistic characters.Hannah Rose, the viewpoint characer, is a woman who transcends time, a woman we easily identify with, a strong woman who goes after her dreams and faces life with honesty and courage, somewhat reminiscent of Ida in Cold Mountain.Meanwhile, the person of Captain Ahab, as seen through the eyes of love, takes on new and intriguing dimensions which make you want to brush off your copy of Moby Dick and read it all over again.",

This book was very basic, and even the chapters on histories night fighters weren't enjoyable.Oh yeah. This book is word for word (I kid you not) the same as ""Street Ninja"" by Dirk Skinner, which is also a very useless book. I don't know if Dirk used a psuedonym for this book, so that he could advertise in it or what, but avoid both of these books at all costs, unless you plan to star in a movie with three little kids and Mr. Miagi.",

I don't understand how it got the excellent reviews that it did. The plot was dull and it left me feeling as though it didn't end. Why did Guthrie's wife act the way she did and leave her little boys? Victoria's mother is introduced only to kick her daughter out of the house.

He often pauses after ever few words (sometimes after every single word) so that you can hardly follow the flow of the ideas. I found it so annoying that I had to stop listening, though I was engaged by the book itself.

I have to say that I'm a little disappointed that so far there's no soundtrack for the film. It has great music in it.,

Not bad for a 4x4x4, but I'm trying to find better.I got pissed because the other night I was doing some speed solves and I was getting close to getting under 3 minutes finally, but suddenly it snapped and like half the pieces came out.

There are several attacking patterns that I guarantee will help your team, as well as concepts and drills to improve individual and group attacking play. For someone who played defense in college and specializes in defense at the collegiate coaching level, the book is helpful if one-sided. The Italians focus on a zonal defense, and in general flat-back defense is detailed. There is some very good stuff in here to help build a defense. Additionally, almost any formation you can imagine is given a quick glance by a professional coach who uses it and notes its advantages and disadvantages. The one criticism I have is the clumsy writing--these guys are definitely not American.",

From Churchill's prescient knowledge of what must be done to Truman's acknowledgement of the danger that Communism posed to Adenauer's firm and unwavering alignment with the West to Solzihentisyn(sp?) showing how the Cold War was really a moral struggle to Pope John Paul II's unwavering determination to free Poland to Ronald Reagan who ultimately caused the end of the Cold War; even though it came under Bush's administration; Shattan demonstrates a keen eye for details and an excellent sense of analysis.

Therefore, I believe the plastic melted, and that it did so in the beginning. There isn't a replacement part. This I found out after waiting on hold for ten minutes. The product is shoddy and unsubstantial. To call it ""commercial"" is a misnomer. I suppose it is no longer in production. I suggest anyone in the market look closely at the PS 250 as it looks quite similar. Check reviews before purchasing.",

__label__2 Wheel Of Time: Artwork has nothing to do with the book. I create all the picturs in my mind anyway. If I want to buy a book for pictures I'll buy a comic book. This book however was great. In the large elaborate world of this series a guide is almost a necessity. I know it takes from some of the intrigue of the book. But there are so many characters that directly relate to the plot that I think some of the facts covered in this book will never see print in the series. I highly recommend this to all true fans. I have read the series almost as many times as there are book in the series. Maybe even more. I am unsure. But I still like the information presented here.

The company shipped the product quickly and everything was very good quality. The problem is it just doesn't work. It is more like holding a water hose to your mouth. The water stream is not fine and directed enough to really remove particles and plaque. The oscillation feature of the Waterpick cleans much more quickly and deeply. I sent it back after trying it and nearly drowning a few times. I rate the company highly as they were very helpful about returning it and getting my money back. Maybe they can improve the design so it really does what it is supposed to do.,

"__label__1 Mobile Library: The greatest thing about this product is that it is a mobile library. Most people don't have a plethora of space to store their books. This device could revolutionize the future of reading.The downsides are that it is extremely expensive and then it costs additional money to add books (about $10 or less a book). Secondly, there are only so many books you can get and most of them are more current and mainstream. If you are a fan of books that are older and maybe less popular, you're out of luck. While the demand remains for this product however, the list of books will grow.In short, I would only recommend this product for people that can't keep books with them for space or because they travel a lot.

The author is too long-winded and seems obsessed with the sexual aspect of the post-World War II American woman's problem. In my opinion she does not focus enough on the educational aspect. The book could have been condensed to half its size, and that would have made for a much better read. You could skip a page or two and not miss anything important. I found myself bored with the repetition and rushing to get through it. Basically, it's a bunch of words speckled with a profound thought every 100 pages or so.

It was raining this morning so I had a chance to see main (Zoeller 57) pump cycle on. That's when I notice water shooting out the bottom of the backup pump. It told me the cheap, garbage, mini check that Zoeller uses on their backup pump failed. I should have followed advice and my instincts to remove their check and use a better check in the system.Zoeller should be ashamed that they compromise what would be a good product had they spent a couple bucks more on a better check.I now have to remove the whole system and rebuild it.

There was far too much sitting around staring at the neighbors to suit me, and the film was much too long to say what it had to say.

"__label__2 Deserves to be better-known: This, the second in Bergman's ""Faith"" trilogy, is a dark, brooding tale of a clergyman who has lost his faith in God. Indeed, it is doubtful at all if he ever had it, for his vision of God is quite selfish. The action takes place on a single Sunday in November, where the town pastor (Gunnar Bjornstrand in an excellent performance) is finishing a service in front of a tiny congregation. During this day, the pastor will be forced to examine himself and to try to reach out for some human contact to replace the spiritual depletion within him. Also starring Max von Sydow, Gunnel Lindblom, and Ingrid Thulin as the schoolteacher who unselfishly offers herself to the pastor but is rejected in favor of the memory of his dead wife. This film has a subtle, deeply wrought poetry to it and should be seen by all lovers of intelligent cinema.",

That all changed when I got ""The Guitarist to sight reading"" Not only My charts are much more professional looking, but I'm also much sharper at My note reading. I am now able to write out certain Rhythmic patterns at any part of the song if I want it there.This book is not only fun, because it has a Cd that can play along with, but you can also see your progress grow in such a short time. A MUST for any serious musician who wants to get thing done neatly and quickly!",
"__label__2 An album with all guts: This set of songs by MR. Jeffreys has been on my musical playlist since I first heard it. To me it's the best selection of material he has produced. Each song has it's own magic of rock,soul and roots. Here it is reissued on cd. The Lp I own sounds great, Now I can have the digital version as well.This is a must have for Garland Jeffreys fans.""Guts for love"" Is a soulful ballad that asks the ultimate question about love and commitment.Rebel love and El salvdore are top notch selections that will have you playing this cd over and over again.",

Generally, I am happier with Szell conducting Mozart or Dave Goulder singing about following along as his dad plowed the fields. BUT about 30 years ago I found the Verve Howard Tate LP with the best of this CD's material on it and it just blew me away! The songs are incredible. Hey, look who has covered them! The arrangements are basic, but perfect. And that voice! Man, Howard Tate is right along side Otis, Aretha, Ray Charles and Bobby Bland! It's no so much that they sing well, though they do of course! They convince you! You BELIEVE them the same way you believe Townes Van Zandt or Hank Williams! Listen to ""Glad I Knew Better"". This is testimony!

The Musical Director for this abomination should be called a Mutilation Director, because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show.

"__label__1 Great Music, Horribly Produced: The songs on this album are all outstanding, but any Specials or Desmond Dekker fans out there are in for a disappointment. The producers decided to run all the instruments and vocals through a reverb effect in an apparent attempt to replicate Phil Spector's Wall Of Sound. In addition, most of the tracks are overrun by sustained synthesizer chords. Ska's catchiest attribute is its sharp rhythms, but the morons in the booth ruined it by drowning out the quality. What's their motivation? Lord knows, but I've always detested producers who try to become part of the act themselves by manipulating the message instead of fine-tuning it. Close your eyes, and you'll think you're trapped in some horrible karaoke bar. These two classic acts deserved better.",

"__label__1 Heavy and unbalanced and no good for me.: I guess other people love this shovel, but I can't stand it. It's really heavy. It's very unbalanced, with all the weight in the shovel head, making it very heavy to lift. I cannot get ANY leverage with it. I live in Maine where you're often having to lift the snow to pile it up on a snow bank (sometimes banks that are 3 to 5 feet tall), or dump it over the railing off my porch. I find the bent handle means I'm having to lift much higher and it takes a lot more twisting to get the snow off. Also, it's very difficult to lift the snow off my steps with it, and the bent handle makes it hard to shovel them from above, so I have to trudge through the snow down to the base of the steps and shovel from below. This is a lot more effort!When I use traditional shovel,I never experience any of the back pain that folks are talking about. Like all things, you need to make certain you're lifting with your legs and your shoulders, not with your back!",

If you fill one to the brim, it is 8 ounces. I can't imagine how they arrived at the very specific (yet apparently arbitrary) 5.625 number.My two key criteria were that (1) I was looking for a glass that would hold around 6oz and (2) I wanted it to be tall and slender.

Fortunately, there are some good solid tracks featured.

Every time I hear the opening strains of ""Just Can't Get You Out Of My Mind"" or ""I'll Be Around"" I know it's time to chill.

"__label__2 One of the few folic acid + Vitamin B complex in ONE pill: I've been taking Sundown Xtra for several years and have found it to be an excellent product. In order for folic acid to be effective in lowering homocysteine levels, it needs to be taken in conjunction with Vitamin 6 & 12, This product allows you to get the benefit of a maximum dose of folic acid (800mcg) and the necessary Vitamin B's ALL in ONE caplet. Much easier than having to buy folic acid and Vitamin B complex *separately* in order to properly augment. Although recent studies have questioned the relevance of homocysteine levels regarding cardiac health, I believe there's a great deal of merit in continuing to take folic acid. My homocysteine levels decreased substantially (from a 14 to an 8) after taking this folic acid/Vitamin B complex combination for six months. I would strongly recommend it.

"__label__2 Proud to show nails: I started using Nailtiques Formula 2 about a year ago. My nails were so thin and if I were lucky enough for them to grow at all, the tips would peel off. I tried many ""nail hardener"" products with no success. Nailtiques is the most amazing product and so easy to use. I don't use any remover - after a few coats are applied, it is so easy just to lift the whole coat off, and start over. I don't try to remove it off all my nails at once - just the ones that appear to need lifting off at the moment. Agreed you must be consistent with the application instructions but it only takes about 3 minutes to apply and dries pretty fast, like 10 minutes or so. This product is much cheaper ordering from amazon.com than buying locally even with shipping and handling.

"__label__2 Excellent value: I Received the shade sooner than I thought. The stainless steel hardware that came with it was of very good quality and really helped in the installation. I attached this shade to the side of my aluminum awning that was on the back of my house, because the sun was shinning under the awning during the afternoon and evening hours. This shade looks very nice, and worked exactly like I wanted it to. I can also unhook it from the poles I put up, and let it hang down the side of the awning to block all the sun and keep the rain from getting under the awning when it's raining. I can tell by the way it's made, that it should last a long time. I paid more for this shade than some of the other's on the market, but I'm glad I did. It's top notch.",
"__label__1 Cuff Didn't Fit Properly: Although this monitor seems to have gotten good ratings from other users overall, the ComFit cuff was very rigid and did not fit my arm at all and kept slipping down to my elbow. This of course lead to error readings consistently. If your arms are bigger on top this cuff probably will not work for you. I instead went with another brand monitor that has a ""Soft Cuff"". Please do your research to determine if a ""rigid"" or ""soft"" cuff with work best for you. I will be returning this monitor because of the rigid cuff.",

Otherwise, it works as advertised.",

I would recommend it for children or newbies. What I do not like is that there is no indication of age group. That would be helpful. I also dislike the excessive use of cliche and old standby religious phrasing. I would recommend instead anything by John MacArthur, Norm Geisler or Michael Youseff.

__label__2 Please stop comparing this show to the original!!!!: First off this is a seperate movie from the original. Also as much as I love Gena Rowlands I did not like the original Gloria so I dont see everyones fascination with it. On its own I thought this show was great. I saw it on tv very early in the morning so my expectations were low. And I am not a very big fan of Sharon Stone at all but I was very presently surprised by this show. Personally I think this is one of her best roles and I thought she did it wonderfully. I think you should give this show a shot based on its own merits alone. Its not the best movie ever but its definitely not the worst either. So basically its touching/heart-warming and has some good action and definitely worth at least a once over so take a chance and may you also be pleasently surprised.,
"__label__2 Good Coverage of Material.: Because the topic is changing so quickly, it is difficult to publish a current book on XML. Even with this disadvantage, the book gives the reader the information needed to understand how XML works, what its potential is, and generally how to implement it. I have two negative comments:1. The book is a too cursory with emerging technologies which will be the mainstay of the technology: DOM, XSL, XSLT, SAX. These parts are critical for implementors and should have been discussed more thoroughly.2. For a book on markup, they should have gotten the table of contents marked up correctly.On the whole, an excellent book. Very readable.",
"__label__2 Sensationally wicked masterpiece!: A best-seller in its day, Quaker City is a violent and surreal look at the life of the citizens of Philadelphia in the 1840s. Anyone who likes Edgar Allen Poe or the Marquis de Sade will find this an interesting read; written off by critics as blatantly pulp, before such a term existed, they considered its mass appeal a sign of weakness, and by 1900, it had vanished from most lists of important American novels. I'm glad that critics are reconsidering its position, and I look forward to more of Lippard's novels coming back to print. Devil-bug, the mastermind of evil, is a great villain, and he looks ahead to Jarry's Pere Ubu, Faulkner's Popeye and many of the great surreal or superreal villains of the twentieth century.",
"__label__2 A Must-Have to any Comic and BATMAN Fan!: First of all I wouldn't call this product a 'toy' per se but a true collectible. this tiny action figure is Batman at his simplest and yet it is the most complex representation in plastic of the Dark Knight.There is not a single classic pose you could not re-create with this figure and more than five extra pair of interchangeable hands can attest to that fact.A decent amount of accesories make this figure a true Collector's kit and even this is not meant for little kids (they tend to be fragile)you can not help but to feel like one when you see Batman on display over his pegged, transparent Stand -also included- in that pose you could never achieve with that old Batman you had when you were a kid.It is a great investment for you, the collector.

I am thinking about taking it apart and selling it again. The reviews for the chair seemed like a great ergonomic solution to back problems and too much sitting in the office. However, at 6'2"" the chair just doesn't work for him. The ball also seems extremely small, even for me at 5'4"". Reviews that I read said that with wear the ball would stretch out and would allow more air to inflate the ball and increase it's size... but we haven't even gotten that far since no one wants to sit on it.

"__label__2 Easy to install: This filter was a breeze to install; granted, the old Kenmore brand filter that this new one replaced was installed with quick-release fittings. While the new filter came with nice brass fittings (with the tread already wrapped in teflon tape!), I decided to use my existing quick-release fittings, which allowed me to swap out the filter in less than a minute. So far, it has been a month, and the water tastes great. The 20,000-gallon life span of this filter was a major factor in my decision. I have well water, and this gives me peace of mind, knowing that my water is getting properly filtered. One thing you may want to do: read the instructions. The manufacturer recommends flushing the filter for a few minutes when you first connect it to the supply line to make sure there is no residual charcoal dust coming out of it. This is normal with most water filters and in spite of having forgotten to do that, I did not experience any problems.",

"__label__1 Barely Competent: The biggest problem of this novel is that it's about a universe instead of being about people. The lead character and his quest never become more than a reason to explore a reasonably inventive worlds that Pratchett created. The search for The Joker's World is nothing more than a Mcguffin and the ultimate reveal comes across as a Grand Finally, not a Grand Finale.Beneath the surface, you can see the emerging charm of Pratchett's writing, but mostly you're wading through disjointed and often confusing encounters with various alien races.Give it a pass,unless you're compelled to read everything Pratchett has written.",

"__label__2 A positive review from a Republican!: Let's get one thing straight, I am a hardcore conservative and will most definitely be voting for Bush in November. While I in no way, shape or form agree with Propagandhi's politics, I still think their music is great, which is kind of weird because they're so closely tied together. For me, their views don't diminish the listenability of this album, because it appeals to me as a rock record. Tracks like ""Purina Hall of Fame"" and ""March of the Crabs"" are great pieces of music, no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on. So if you by chance are a right-winger and like kickass hardcore with a little melody, download a few of these songs, you might be surprised.",

This thing has a plastic joint when extended and I broke two of them (at the plastic joint) within a few months. Kata was good to me and replaced it once for free but I broke it again.

Since the dog is otherwise very sweet and a wonderful playmate for my 6-year-old granddaughter, I knew we had to do something to keep her. We installed the fence, not in the ground, but on the existing fence a few inches off the ground and looped back some 3 feet above that wire. To begin, I should have set the collar at level 3. Instead, I set it at 5 and gave the poor dog a really rough shock. I set it to 3 and she feels it but doesn't yelp like she's being tortured. At the moment, she is leery of going back outside, but I think she'll be ok as soon as she realizes she still has the rest of the yard to play in.",

If you are a die-hard Grinch fan, this will either be a great pre-Christmas Grinch fix, or, you will be offended that they could ever try to re-capture the ingeniusness of The Grinch in a non-HTGSC format. This is a Halloween story, about how the Grinch comes down from his mountain once a year to scare the Whos. We all know that this not true, but it's ok. It isn't horrible, and the music is really fun. But does it cut the mustard as a long-standing Grinch classic? Heck no.",

Every time I do I'm amazed at what I read and how far ahead of their time they really were. Benjamin Franklin epitomizes this; printer, scientist, inventor, diplomat, politician and above it all human. This book gets into some of that nitty-gritty; the women, the ruthless businessman, more women, questionable husband and father.The author does an amazing job walking us through Franklin's life and showing us the brilliance of the man and the fallibility at the same time.Wonderful read and would recommend it to everyone - just be prepared to devote some time to it.",

With wit and humor Chelsea revisits several one night stands that stood out in her life. Accompanied by her saucy group of gal pals, Handler takes on every city with the same attitude: find a glass of vodka and a hot man, STAT!It's completely irreverent and full of language that will disgust the average prude, this is a memoir for anyone who enjoys Chelsea's naughty sense of humor.",

"__label__2 Terrific case for running with Nike+: I would highly recommend this case if you are a runner and are using the Nike+ iPod system. I have had this case for almost a year and I still love it. I use it several times a week for running, as well as, during my training for a half marathon. I live in very hot climate and I don't even notice that I have it on my arm. The dual straps for wrist or upper arm placement make it even better. In the winter months, the wrist position works well wtih a long sleeve top. This case provides a tight fit for the iPod and the Nike+ receiver, while the clear window provides easy access for selections on the iPod. I will buy another as the neoprene is beginning to split where it has to fit over the receiver but it definitely was worth the price, considering how much I have used it.",

But this is not Braveheart, and it isn't trying to be.Roland Emmerich really shows that he is a great director who can handle a great script without destroying it with specialeffects. After Independence Day and Godzilla, Roland has finally stopped relying on the effects (allthough there are effects, but they do not own the screen at any time) and started to trust his own skills.He also has great help from the cast. Mel Gibson is great as both the carrying father, and as the cruel buther he is in war. Heath Ledger is abolutley a name to recon with for the future, and makes the son very well.So all and all this is a graet movie, that does NOT make all englishmen out to be a sead of evil, that some people have claimed.",

"__label__1 A waste of time and money: Computer books seem to break down into one of three major categories: theoretical concept overviews, exhaustive step-by-step learning guides, or pinpoint reference guides (e.g. O'Reily In-A-Nutshell). This book is a muddled mix of all three without achieving the benefits of any. It's too lightweight and disorganized to be a reference manual and too cursory to be a learning guide.I am over 100 pages into this and I am not quite sure if I have learned anything useful. It was clearly written without an objective in mind, which is evident chapter after chapter. It was comforting to see that many others share my opinion. I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing.",

But while I can take and even enjoy a mild amount of sick jokes, this crossed the line by about 50 miles. The saddest thing was that this was a hit. There were a few chuckles and one huge laugh,the wazzup scene, but otherwise it was just people making fun of small penises, penisis caught in thongs, and more penises. If you want a horror parody go see ""Shreik if you know what I did last friday the 13th"".How this was not rated x I will never know. If this is where societies headed the human race should not survive.JUST SAY NO!!!!",

Currently, I think is the best book about Infectious diseases.",
"__label__1 Sub-Par Star Trek Movie: While better than Insurrection, overall this movie stinks. I would actually give it two and a half stars. This one feels very forced, and while I appreciate the inclusion of the Romulans in a movie, it simply isn't ever convincing that Shinzon would want to destroy Earth. Even with the backstory they do provide, I couldn't believe he wants it that badly. The sudden addition of a new sub-class of Remans is lame. One could write off the coincidence of a race of aliens, just happening to share their name with the mythical founder of Rome. But when all of a sudden we learn of an off-breed of the same race that shares it's name with Romulus' brother Remus it becomes laughable. And perhaps it's a bit cruel, but Brent Spiner has gained weight since the series ended, and it's just odd to see the android Data with a second chin. Sorry, no good.",
"__label__2 A Matter of Trust: A Matter of Trust By: Anne SchraffThe book is mainly about trust. The author's purpose of writing the story is mainly to say to trust people even if you do not want to. The main characters in novel are Brisana Meeks, Darcy Wills, and Hakeem Randall. Darcy and Hakeem are dating and they think that trust is big factor in a relationship. Brisana Meeks is a trouble maker who loves to make people angry. My favorite character is Darcy because she learned to put her trust in people and let them learn to trust her. She also learned to forgive and forget all the hurtful things people have done to her. You can learn to relate to other people through the things they have been through. I would recommend this book to people who like to read romantic, suspenseful, and comedy books. I would also recommend this book to both male and female teenagers who like to read.",

The lead actor was superb in his role, his acting was very good. And Michelle Rodriguez, I could watch all day, she's great. Several of the other soldiers also did a great job of acting. The script in places was sophomoric but some marines and army rangers I knew were just like that in real life. The aliens and their weapons were great, the scenes of a destroyed LA was great, and it had a great ending. I look forward to a directors cut with more footage. Was it ""Gone with the Wind"" or something, no it wasn't, but it was still a good movie.",

Third founding member Hartmt Enke opted not to participate, so the 2 old friends played together alone. ""Gin Rose"" is a 69 minute track, constanly evolving. Themes heard on ""Reunion"" pop up here and there, but as a whole this album struck me as more low key. As with the ""Reunion"" album, this sounds like what you would expect if you crossed late 90's Klaus Schulze with Manuel Gottsching. Reccomended.",

Superb thriller is a surprise gem, complete with high-octane suspense and scares. The initially subdued and creepy set-up builds nicely to the last half-hour, a terrifying knockout. Kudos to Steve Zahn for a wonderful performance (he also has good chemistry with Paul Walker) and to John Dahl's taut direction. The film may be a little too elaborate at times with a couple of illogical moments, but you'll be too enthralled to care. Enthusiastically recommended.",

Surprisingly, ""king of scary"" director Wes Craven, does a mediocre job revamping the final sequel. It plays on the original Scream, and pretty has the same story line, just a tad bit more gruesome. The movie starts of with a series of movies with a movie. Scream 4, plays on the whole android/ iPhone bit, using an ""app"" to prank call people using the scream voice.

"__label__2 Exceeded expectations--a great read: Not being a fan of the usual election campaign books, I took this up with low expectations. I just wanted to know something about Ronald Reagan's first campaign for governor. I also suspected that it would be something of a hatchet job on RR. To my pleasant surprise, Matthew Dallek has produced an engaging--even exciting--narrative that is very well balanced. Though he does tend to laud the ""responsible liberalism"" of Edmund ""Pat"" Brown, the Democratic incumbent that Reagan unseated, he also fairly portrays the new conservatism and ""Creative Society"" philosophy of Ronald Reagan and his supporters. I highly recommend this work as essential for understanding the beginnings of the Reagan Revolution. After this, a good read that bookends the subject is John Ehrman's 'The Eighties: America in the Age of Reagan.'",

In fact, the trio are an education.Chinese reviewer Dayu Zhang put it absolutely beautifully. This is a virtuoso performance about timing and melody -- and those who don't understand that slow jazz (like slow blues) is an almost impossibly hard genre to master will just not get this album.Excellent sales show that the unbiased and unprejudiced listener will get it -- once again, it is hard to imagine a listener who won't love this.I hope Gustaven will follow Jan Garbarek in providing us with delight for decades to come.Highly recommended to all.",

I put off purchasing this book many times because although I like true crime, I am really not enthusiastic about reading stories where innocent babies are murdered, by their own mother nonetheless. It was pitiful the way this woman snuffed out the lives of her innocent children, and for no obvious reason. Hard to believe that when her babies were dying one by one in the 1960's, no one thought it peculiar. If this were happening to someone I know now, I would certainly think something was up.

This CD has all the songs I know and love, such as Pinch Me, One Week, and If I Had $1,000,000, plus some truly great ones I've never heard before, such as Get In Line, and the Wizard of Magicland. I was slightly disappointed it didn't have ""Who Needs Sleep"", ""Some Fantastic"" or ""Never is Enough"" but you can't have everything.I happen to know that this band didn't get famous for being a bunch of pretty boys, like certain other bands I can mention.

It's a crying shame Kilzer never received more acclaim than he did, although he was pretty popular in the Little Rock/Memphis area for a while. Not only was he a great song writer and musician, but a very cool dude as well who never turned down a chance to play for anyone. I saw him perform at the Pi Kappa Alpha frat house on the campus of UALR. No band - only a guitar, harmonica, and the man himself, and he is just as good live as in the studio.

"__label__1 What was the point of that?: Yes Michael Cunningham is a wonderful writer of prose, but it is inserted in unrealistic streams of consciousness revelations during his characters' mundane activities. The lack of action in this book causes the focus to be on the characters who are revealed as self-absorbed, narcissistic and somewhat delusional while consistently whiny. It is not hard to discern why this book, as insignificant as it is, has been lauded by the press and Hollywood. It caters to sympathies that the press and Hollywood universally suscribe to without a search for greater truths or real meaning. Additionally, the writer creates no sense of urgency or intrigue for the reader. It is the equivalent of watching a soap opera in which the writers are trying their best to write like Shakespeare.",

There is NO explanation as to why this girl is dead and still alive. It's not that she's even a zombie needing Brains for dinner.

Historians and philosophers will continue to debate whether Lao Tzu ever existed or, if the Tao Te Ching was the work of many men. This book, however, portrays a decidedly Judeo/Christian perspective to the man called Lao Tzu and his life and times. The book is inacurate in it's portayal of life and philosophy/religion during the Han Dynasty. The author clearly misrepresents the history and beliefs in ancient China in a desire to mold Chinese thinking into a monotheistic belief system. If the reader is willing to set aside the historical and philosophical truths of the Chineses culture, the story is set forth as a very sweet parable.

"__label__1 Shoddy Quality: I ordered this with some reservations as the reviews were hit and miss. I definitely fell in the miss category as the product I received did not roll smoothly at all. Being an engineer, I examined it (after all, how complex can a rolling pin be?) and found that the handle is somehow fitted eccentrically to the marble. The result is that instead of a smooth motion, the rolling pin rolls a few inches and then binds and locks up so the handles do not spin freely. I immediately contacted Amazon to return this product.It was an OK gamble given the price, but save yourself the trouble. In fact, I'd say that the use of marble and materials to make this product is just a waste of resources. I'd recommend looking for something that is fitted with nylon bearings at a minimum and stainless steel if you work a lot with pastry.

Therefore, any bad review which I give must be due to the performance of his work. Hungarian Rhapsody no 2 is one of the most beautiful pieces of music in existance. It is originally a piano piece, but the piece on this CD has been orchestrated - with an absolutely disastrous effect. One not only does one not get the wonderful strong rhythm that the hungarian rhapsody should provide, but the choice of instruments of whoever orchestrated this piece actually makes this work sound bad. The other tracks on this CD are played well enough, but if you are looking for the best of Liszt, you will not be satisfied as Hungarian R. no. 2 is a monumental work of Liszt.",
"__label__2 AWESOME CASE: Hi everybody. I got this case today, and it is the best case in the world. When I went to the airport, it felt like it wasn't even there!!! It is very light, nice color, but it doesn't have that much storage, but it is still great!!!",
__label__1 Awkward lid: I purchased this kettle based on the reviews I read from amazon and was disappointed to find out no one mentioned how awkward the lid was. You cannot pour water from the kettle without opening the lid or else water will leak from the sides. This means the steam from the kettle will burn your hand. I am returning this kettle and forking over some extra money for a Russell Hobbs that has been tried and tested by me. Its a little bit pricey but my last Russell Hobbs lasted me 10 years.,

It's alternative with a bit of a metal edge made by a bunch of Gucci-wearing, (...). Let's call it for what it is.Why the 2 stars? I figured they deserved something for being better than the other mainstream bands, such as Taproot, Puddle of Mudd, P.O.D., Creed, Nickelback, Linkin Park, etc. etc. etc. These guys may be sell-outs but they still play better stuff than all those other bands and they can still play live shows well.(...)But please, people, this is sell-out since it isn't thrash and Metallica made it to get more radio play. Shame on them. This band died with Cliff.",
"__label__1 Let Down: Point Blank had me all the way through; then let me down at the end. I don't like investing time reading 425 pages of mystery only to have one of the main threads (who killed Christie, Dillon's wife) left unanswered. I admit the author held my interest and entertained me right up there with James Patterson and John Kellerman, but Point Blank's ending...it was like Ms. Coulter suddenly remembered she had something more important to do and she deserted me! Not only was a main thread left open, all threads were wrapped up poorly. Is a sequel planned here?",
"__label__2 another excellent book: As with previous Petzold's Programming Windows books, this book tells you the nuts and bolts of windows programming, in C#. In details explained real well. I especially enjoy the little pieces of history as introduction in each chapter. Petzold even give you a brief math lesson when explaining Bezier curves. But this book does not give you a real-world-app, but the knowledge of details that make you build one. The appendix of math and string class will be helpful for anyone doing real programming.",

"__label__1 A CHINESE SPAGHETTI WESTERN REMAKE OF 'LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD': A Sino-samurai movie striving for style with random I CHING prophesy thrown in for dialog. It might play better in the theatre. It might look better on DVD or Blu ray. What I watched was an old VHS version that looked like a third generation dupe, practically no detail at all.That said, evidently some versions of this movie please some people. I have to admit, there is something there, I'm not too sure what. Imitation Morricone soundtrack kept me looking for Clint Eastwood in his poncho just over the next sand dune, but he never materialized.If I come across a used Blu ray of this I may give it another look. I'm not sure if I saw 'Ashes of Time', or the Redux version, the title on the cassette box was all in Chinese and on two tapes, even though the running time was only 100 minutes. Go figure.",
"__label__2 Recipe for the Wicked Underground: Take the following 3 ingredients: 1 part ""musical growth & tightness"" of the mid-90's ""Dysfunctional / Shadowlife"" era DOKKEN (Lynch & Pilson's household name band), 1 part ""hard rockin' crunch"" of LYNCH MOB (Lynch's band offering after 80's split of DOKKEN), & 1 part ""vocal punch"" of WAR & PEACE (Pilson's band offering after 80's split of DOKKEN), stir it up and BOOM! You have LYNCH / PILSON - WICKED UNDERGROUND. If you are looking for the sound of the DOKKEN - UNDER LOCK & KEY (One of my Top 5 Best Hard Rock picks ever)days, this is not it. BUT! This is 4 Star, hard rock bliss! Tight songs, KILLER guitar work (as always from Lynch) & decent vocals (Not DON DOKKEN level but decent) make this a must for the true DOKKEN ""family"" fan & an enjoyable ride for the hard rock fan of the 80's.",

"__label__2 A laid-back mix of accordion, tabla and voice--soulful, cool: Gilberto Gil has been making music since the mid '60s. I like to think of him as the Brazilian Paul McCartney: a master melodist, warm singer, and committed pop conceptualist. His influence over today's music has been subtle, but it's hard to imagine Arto Lindsay, Carlinhos Brown or Tortoise without Gil. His last album, ""Quanta,"" was good but maybe a little too slick. ""O Sol De Oslo"" is his most natural-sounding, relaxed record in years. Texturally Trilok Gurtu's percussion adds that certain element of mysticism that has been present in Gil's work from the beginning. In fact Gil is one of the few pop artists who can combine that ineffable feeling of joy with a finely honed formal beauty. ""O Sol"" is immensely enjoyable; it's too bad earlier albums like ""Realce"" (1978) and ""Refazenda"" (1975) aren't more readily available in the United States, not to mention his groundbreaking ""tropicalist"" work from the swinging sixties.",

"__label__2 Fun to read & great presentation: This book was fun and quite addictive! It contains a collection of unrelated design principles that can be browsed and read in random order. The presentation is very attractive. Can be recommended not only to marketers and designers, but also to anybody merely remotely interested in this topic.The weakness is that there is no attempt to create a frame work, overall guidance, or step-by-step advice on how to combine these principles.",
"__label__2 A gripping, easy-to-read book, but a not light-hearted story: Compared to music categories, I would definitely place this book rather in the ""commercial"" genre. But - and that's what I like about it - commercial, easy-to-read with quality.The book deals with the rape and murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon and the way her family copes with this loss after her death. On every move of her sister Lindsey, her little brother Buckley, her parents and her murderer, Susie is watching from heaven.There are moments when you will feel tears getting in your eyes, small details that show how much Alice Sebold knows about the pain and fear she is writing about. If you are looking for a stirring, fine little novel you will not be able to put down easily, go for it. You will not be disappointed.",

The basic story could have been good, but the majority of the plot twists and turns were sophomoric, at best. It read like a love-struck high school kid was writing a novel for a composition class. Don't waste your time. Enjoy Angels and Demons, along with The DaVinci Code, and let it go at that.",
"__label__2 The End of Marketing as Sergio Zyman knows it: 1) Internet is missing from the discussion totally. 2) This discussion applies only to broadcast media. 3) There is no discussion of personalization - the necessity of offering actual information. 4) As Steve Jobs never quite said, What can you expect from a guy who spent his life selling sugar water?",
"__label__2 FINALLY!!: Finally, a wonderful, comprehensive resource to help the average person, who wants to make the change to a healthier lifestyle! I've always felt overwhelmed, with so much conflicting information as to what's safe and what's not. I found out about this book, from the Weston A. Price website - another awesome resource for finding out the truth. The absolute best part of this book, for me (because, honestly, a lot of the ""chemical"" details are over my head) - are the lists, at the back, of specific products (in each category - hair, face, deoderants etc) that have been tested as absolutely safe. This was so helpful, for me... to have all the research and legwork done, and to be able to simply look up each category, and find out where to buy it. It allowed me to slowly and methodically eliminate my family's personal care products that were harmful and, confidently, replace them with safe ones. The website offers ongoing updates on newly added ""Safe"" products. This is an excellent gift.",

I could have hired an attorney to settle my claim, but I first wanted to see what it might be worth and how the system worked. This book was extremely helpful. I was able to successfully resolve the property damage claim for a reasonable amount and the bodily injury claim as well all without hiring an attorney. The book has a lot of good advice and sample letters to assist in writing claims and what to do to negotiate or further pursue the claim after the first few settlement offers. This book, along with a lot of patience, was very helpful in my settling my own claim. I'm very glad I purchased it.",

This is the type of book you can give to almost anyone, and they will enjoy reading it. I'm a biologist with a background in conservation, and I really enjoyed reading about the natural history of many of the plants and animals in the book. I've given the book to two other people, and they both loved it, but for completely different reasons. One enjoyed all the detailed descriptions of cooking and meals; while the other was more interested by the social and economic aspects of the book. The author does a great job of weaving together several fairly disparate topics into a very entertaining narrative.",

So be it, some families are like that, but when Ms Lowell introduced an incestous relationship, I was unsettled to say the least.

This gives a great description of the wonderful women behind this artwork that she creates. I believe she should be more emphisized when people think of art. This book really explains who she is.

It seems like Sylvian keeps getting more and more interested in making perfect little soundscapes as a means to an end, instead of using the 'scapes as a means for connection to a listener.

The imagery in it is grotesque, potentialy offensive, and deeply disturbing.

The tapes are sold separately too, and you need them.This book gives you sentences and has words but if you are new to arabic this is not the place to start. It has the words that will be covered in a sentence and the constructs the sentences in every possible way.Ex. I want a book, she wants a book, he wants a book, they want a book she wants him to have a book. ect.It is a good book if you already have a good basic understanding of the arabic and its grammer otherwise leave this one alone, and learn from another book and practice with this one.",

"__label__2 used as sensory motor activity: I am a Pediatric Occupational Therapist who uses this book during our summer program. We use a different theme every week with the children and during our camping week, I use this to make an obstacle course to go along with the book. First use a holla hop hung from the ceiling with streamers hanging from it for the grass. balance beam over the blue paper to be the river. Half moon rubber like disks to simulate the squelchy mud. Make a forest of trees to stumble trip thru. Use a bubble machine to go thru the whirling snowstorm and at last get to the dark cave they crawl into and find the bear.This is such a fun book both my boys loved when growing up! I continue to love the book and use it as a great sensory motor activity for the children as they venture thru the story themseleves.Melissa Evans",

The elephant makes this wounded swan noise that as far as I've seen in nature programs, elephants never make. It's a cute show but Stompy makes that death throes of a swan wailing noise about 87 times and my niece watches it at least twice a week. So thanks Nickelodeon for making kids dvd's even more irritating for adults to listen to.",
"__label__2 I really like it: but now that I'm 12 I had to find another book and ask my mom for more stuff, because this book doesn't address sex AT ALL. It's okay for eight-year-olds, or younger if you develop earlier. It could have more info on stuff like anorexia, because I was sort of interested in that. It never said anything about boys, or lesbians, or how babies are made. Otherwise, it was good. They should make an older girls' one.I'm only 12 and at my school I've already kissed boys and my friend got drunk one time and they could have said more about this.",

"__label__1 Horrible Kindle experience at a rip-off price: DeLillo is one of the greatest American fiction writers, and ""White Noise"" is a magnificent novel. But don't buy the Kindle edition, which will completely destroy your reading experience. For some reason, the text loads to the device with a line space between every single paragraph.That's right. A line space between every single paragraph. Like this.And that means there's also a line space between every line of dialogue, even if a character speaks only a couple of words.The result is so disorienting, and such an insult to the author, that I bought the physical book (not from Amazon, I might add). If you love literature, throw away your Kindle and buy real books from real bookstores. At $13 plus shipping, Kindle downloads aren't even a bargain any more.",
__label__1 Learning to Program with Visual Basic: I had to buy this book for a class and frankly it is not a good book. Lots of code errors that make it confusing. Every one of my classmates complained about the book. The professor eventually told us to not use the book and he gave handouts he had written instead.,
"__label__2 This movie is how all movies should be set.: This movie is pure fantasy. Put it in your VCR and be taken away to another, almost, surrealistic place. While the story itself could be polished there was enough here to make it a favorite. Each actor did a really great job at epitomizing what their character stood for. However, I think the writer could have had made them more dynamic. I agree that it did end too soon without resolution. But isn't that the point...the longing? All in all, a beautifully set movie with an excellent soundtrack and terrific cast makes it worth the price of admission.",
"__label__1 Very disappointed -- got the dreaded E18 error ....: I bought this camera from amazon in May 2005. It was GREAT until I got the E18 error on Halloween. (That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.) Then I started googling and found it seems to be some sort of design problem with these cameras. That wouldn't bother me much if Canon was willing to work with people but I was quoted the same roughly $100 repair price as an earlier reviewer with the short 3 mo. warranty on the repair. If I trusted that the camera would actually stay fixed, I'd do it because otherwise I really like the camera. But I don't trust it and I'm not impressed with Canon's customer service. I previously had problems with a Kodak digital camera and Kodak was good about repairing it free of charge even when the warranty had expired.So I'm staying away from Canons now.",

The only thing I don't like is that the pictures are not the greatest but this hasn't really been a problem for me. In short, if you want to grade better then get the book. The sub-par pictures aren't enough to detract too much.",

__label__1 Not much better than Yahoo Maps!: It is not worth paying for the same features you get on Yahoo Maps. In the NYC area commercial vehicles are not allowed on the Garden State Parkway or the Holland Tunnel. I thought with this program one could tell it to avoid those routes. This program cannot do that. Our company just spent almost $40.00 on software that is no more functinal than Yahoo Maps. The only thing that is nice is that there are no ads.,
"__label__1 Don't waste your money on this DVD release!!!: The movie isn't half bad for a spaghetti western comedy, however the idea of East meets West was much better executed in Red Sun (1972) starring Charles Bronson & Toshiro Mifune. The one star rating is for the awful DVD transfer you are getting. The source material must have been a poor quality VHS copy complete with plenty of stretch marks (visible throughout movie),which in turn used a totally worn out 16 or 35mm print as its source. If you are a die hard Eli Wallach fan, and you want to see him in a fairly hard to find movie, then by all means, buy it. To everybody else,I recommend waiting for a better quality DVD release that will do this movie justice. Better yet, give ""Red Sun"" a try.",
"__label__1 Delightfully Surprisingly Enjoyable: I discovered this book quite accidentally. I had never heard of Amanda Quick (or Jayne Ann Krentz). I thought it would be boring, but it was engrossingly interesting. I thought the hero was a very sexy guy and the heroine was ok,if not quite believable. The plot was obvious almost from the beginning, but I still had no trouble reading it. I plan to read all the books I can by Amanda and Jayne Ann.",
"__label__2 Can't believe no one has reviewed this yet!: I bought this album as it featured constantly in critics fave lists over the years (especially remember reading about Dreamer in a Desert Island Collection by Australian music critic Stuart Coupe in an ex-girlfriend's magazine one lazy afternoon). Bobby sings like no-one else. He has this growl that at first seems out of place - it's so unexpected. But he puts such feeling into building up each tune - no song of his starts on high emotion - Bobby likes the slow burn, you dig? When I play his music for my friends they think it's someone having a laugh - sort of like comedian Lenny Henry doing his Theo T Wildebeast routine (especially going by the photos in the jacket too - they're in a classic pimp style). But to true lovers of soul you can tell that Mr Bland is the real thing. Defintitely worth a listen.",
"__label__2 I WAS THERE: Ok, I am on my way to buy this DVD, but I must tell you I was actually at this show....I'd known a grand total of four BOC songs, but that didn't take away from the enjoyment at ALL. It was a fantastic show that was energetic, electric, and mystifying. Their lead guitar player shredded up Navy Pier, he was that good. I highly reccommend this DVD because the show was an absolutely spectacular one that I will never forget. You might even see me there! Peace out and, please, let the girl rock and roll.",

The Jesus I know taught of tolerance and love, of which neither can be found in this book. The knowledge you will gain from this book is against what Jesus would do.",
"__label__1 Memoirs for his family on some mediocre lived life: The style of the author is like listening to a person that likes to talk about himself all the time. Kinda reminds me of the 1980 movie ""Airplane"" when the ex-fighter pilot tells the story of his life to the passengers; they end their lives in different ways after having to hear him...There are no issues if you planned on finding one. There is no summary and never any conclusion to the issue of racism. It is an amusing story of a 36 year old that has dillidallied in the fight for Black Power. His talk about racism is not scientific nor scholar but simply comes across as to what he's heard. Just alot of personal events that make you dizzy in trying to remember that the author indeed has a point to tell after all the irrelevant details of his story come in pages after pages of paper product.Amusing, yes, informative, no. I cant see either Whites or Blacks reading this and taking him seriously. So who's left? Nah, us Latinos just nod our heads...",
"__label__1 Not Indianna Jones: I can sum up this movie in 5 words, what was the director thinking? What really made this movie unbearable and just absolutly ridiculous was the the script! The mysterious crystal skull plot from the begining I felt was stupid, from the moment I saw it in the theater. And the way it lead to Aliens was just plain si-fi foolishness. I don't want to make too big a deal over it, but that's not the traditional Indiana Jones theme. I'm sure if you all remember they were no other wordly creatures in any of the movies. This was one was a real mockery of Indiana Jones. I have no desire to buy it, really, and I don't think the traditional Indiana fans would either.",

You've made your point but if you will read the rest of the reviews, you'll find that you are CERTAINLY in the minority, so enough ALREADY! I found the musical arrangements wonderful and Russell's renditions of Core'ngrato, Recondita armonia and Vesti la giubba....perfection!! I do, however, agree that it's time for him to rest his voice before he does his 4th CD. 3 CD's in such a short amount of time plus all the promotional trips and personal performances certainly must play havoc on an entertainer's voice. I consider him to be a rare performer with a beautiful, powerful voice that is always ""on key"", such feeling he projects and such a nice demeanor with his audiance.

"__label__1 Lost battle: A terrible movie and a complete waste of time, unless you are a big fan of computer games such as Call of Duty World at War and Black Ops. It is an almost uninterrupted orgy of noise and screams. After ten minutes I was totally exhausted. The characters are completely one-dimensional. Macho men running and shooting at everything that moves. They communicate by cliche oneliners. The storyline is as flat as the heartbeat of a recently deceased person. After fifteen minutes or so, I was so bored, numbed and fed up by it all that I ""switched off"", crept behind my newspaper and left it to my son and his friends to complete the viewing. From behind the newspaper I patiently endured the endless string of gunshots, explosions and shouted commands. Do not be fooled: there's hardly any science in this fiction, it's just a ""one-in-a-dozen"" war movie. I cherished the silence as almost never before when at last the TV set was switched off.

It is jam packed with so much information, I read it for 5 days straight.I would recommend this to anyone interested in the magical use of herbs, not just Hoodoo practitioners.

Once you get used to the (odd) style, you can follow an authoritative account of the U.S. Third Army through its training days and then its arrival in the European theatre, with the spectacular results that ensued. It is, as it should be, a rollicking sort of book, that recounts the events in mannish fashion. It's quick and (relatively) easy to read and adds something to our knowledge of this American hero of the Second World War who, had he had his way, might have started a third immediately!

The motor is a little loud and he would startle when it was started up. Honestly, I'm not quite sure why he didn't like it, except to say that it does provide a lot of stimulation, so be careful if your child is easily overwhelmed. This review isn't here to bash the swing, just to say that some kids like it very simple and don't require all the gadgets and gizmos. He loves his plain old bouncer. We subsequently purchased a FP open top take-along swing which we've had better success.",
"__label__2 Nice Album, Great Band: Well lets pu it this way, they are not very known in the world but that makes it even better. Their music is pure Punk rock, which I love. If you're a fan of Rufio, Millencolin, Sum 41, Pennywise, etc you should get an album from these fellows. Just listen to the song called 'Jackie Chan's Army' MI6 is definetely a great punk rock band.-- Andr√©s",

"__label__1 Boat Anchor: I should preface this by saying that I love IBM laptops -- I've had several (including the T42 I'm using to write this review) and agree they really are the gold standard for laptops. Although they may lack some of the whiz-bang features of HP and Dell machines, they are bullet proof, and have the best keyboards I've ever used.With that... I'd take a pass on this machine. Lenovo (who accquired IBM thinkpad operations) sells consumer machines that cost a few hundred dollars more than this, but are able to run current operating systems. With the soon to come release of the next version of Windows, this machine won't do. Moreover, it hard drive is small, and would require an upgrade for many applications, such as photos, mp3's, etc. Or, if I really wanted an IBM machine, I'd troll E-bay for more current used machines or factory refurbs.",

"__label__2 Homeschooling: The Middle Years: This is a very informative book especially for first-time homeschoolers. It was well written and very well organized. The resources listed were very helpful.My only complaint was the unnecessary criticism of classroom teachers. Unless Ms. Henry was once a classroom teacher herself, I feel she is unqualified to claim that ""the most average high school graduate could produce average work in this not-so-challenging college major."" I was disappointed in this display of subjective writing in an otherwise well-written book.",

"__label__1 1 star is generous!: Some of Martin Lawrences stuff is extreme, but I was expecting some laughs out of this film. There was a 'tee-hee' here and there, but this movie was obviously trying to be a serious moral drama, as opposed to anything remotely funny. I kept waiting for the laughs, and they never came. This movie was the worst comedy I've seen. Watch something else and save yourself the pain.",
"__label__2 perfect in its own little nifty way: Shanghai Knights is an interesting movie. Of course it could have been better....but come on, it could have been worse. I personally thought it was a great movie! It had humor, sword fights, fist fights, and great actors. Now, this movie made me a HUGE fan of Aidan Gillen-he's great as Lord Rathbone. Of course Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are spectacular too- as are the secondary characters. See this movie. It's a great movie!!(((the DVD extras are amazing: deleted scenes, audio commentary from the director and screen writers, a music video entitled ""action overload"" featuring all the fight scenes, and a ""fight manual"" with Jackie Chan and the director(David Dobkin)...all in all...the DVD is a great buy)))",

I have read many reviews for this cd, i dont thinkreviewers are even listening to the cd.THIS BAND DOES NOT SOUND LIKE KILLSWITCH ENGAGE.Many people have compared them to killswitch because of the clean vocals, Caliban has been around just as long as Killswitch and always used clean vocals. HOWERVER, Caliban does not use clean vocals nearly as much Killswitch, and also Caliban's music is much heavier and far less accessible. This is a very go for the throat style of metalcore. Check is out if you like... on broken wings,blood has been shed, unearth, etc..",
"__label__1 no news here: I had high hopes for this book but if you read it you will find nothing that hasn't already been reported elsewhere. Jake Tapper's Down and Dirty had everything this book does, and more. Take this book's big revelation that a Gore advisor started the rumor that Jeb and Katherine Harris were having an affair. Tapper's book already reported that. That Gore was craftily micromanaging the recount effort with an eye toward just recounting counties that were pro-Democrat--Tapper already got all that. And on and on. Sammon makes a big deal about the fact that Gore staffers were happy when they got 1,000 overseas ballots tossed out. But is it news--or surprising--that they were happy? I'm sure Jim Baker and his guys were happy when the US Supreme Court voted the way it did, but I don't need a reporter to tell me that fact as if it were a big, important, revealing secret.If you want the full story, this is not the book. What a disappointment.",
"__label__1 Unflattering and makes me too hot!: I'm an attachment parent so baby wearing is a daily thing for my family. I've tried every kind of wrap, sling or carrier, and the Moby wrap made me so uncomfortable I almost had to ask my husband to cut me out of it. First off, I'm tall and slender, and when I would wear my daughter in it, I looked pregnant again. It's so unflattering. Too bulky. Also, even in the dead of winter, it made me so hot I couldn't wear it. I'm sure I was having hot flashes because of breast feeding hormones, but isn't it inferred/implied that the woman wearing the Moby wrap might be breast feeding?! If you're looking for an easy way to wear your baby, IMO go for a ring sling. On a daily basis I use the Sakura Bloom linen slings. It takes a little practice, just like any baby carrier does, but once you get it you just slip your baby in and go. And you don't have to take it completely apart to take it off. And it won't make you look like you're twice your size.",
"__label__1 I hear their next release will include a fold out shopping bag.: I, like many others, wanted to like this CD, but was really disappointed. A lot of work obviously went into the creation of this. They have an interesting sound at first that quickly gets predictable.I thought the first song was decent enough, but after that the CD spirals downward fast. The main problem, as many reviewers have noted, is the singers voice, which is often hard to hear. But if I had a voice like his, I'd probably want it towards the back of the sound mix.The most original thing about this CD was the liner notes/lyrics, which are presented in the form of a funeral program. Get it? Cool, huh?",
"__label__2 Fantastic cartoon, but...: I really liked the animation in this movie, and was really blown away by all the cartoons.The blue Navajos were amazing, and the screeching bird flyers sounded and looked real. I also liked how the environment looked alive, like every milky strand of flarnsdroppers and cranstrappers was a conscious, sentient, non-cartoon.HOWEVER... (I write in caps for emphasis.)After seeing this movie, I read a book. It had a plot and characters. And while I read it, I thought. I give the book I read 4 out of 5 stars -- minus one star because it didn't have cool-looking cartoons in it. But it had other stuff.In conclusion, I recommend books.",
__label__2 Great History Unveiled: I have almost finished this book and it is an easy read and very informative. I was never taught a fraction of what is in this book concerning the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The young should be taught true history. The author portrays the evil of this time and it compares with the Nazis actions and the evils of the Russian Revolution. I know we have been allies of France in many wars but to bury the atrocities of history because of this is wrong. It was a time and an evil that gripped a people and has been repeated through out history. Evil is not characteristic to one group or nation. God bless the Catholic martyrs of the French Revolution. We could learn much from the way they lived and died for their Catholic beliefs.,

"__label__2 Two Thumbs Upward for The Downward Spiral: Okay, I don't necessarily buy into all of Trent Reznor's lyrics (""God is dead, and no one cares...""), but poetry aside, this album deserved all of the critical acclaim it received. The Nine Inch Nail composed what I consider to be one of the best albums of the 1990's, and Reznor shows that Industrial music is not just out there to be danced to. Nine Inch Nails uses a superb mixture of high-reverb guitars, keyboards, sound effects and beats to portray a spectrum of emotional highs and lows compressed into a flow which I feel is on par with Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side Of The Moon."" Reznor packs a hard and noisy whallop on the first half of the album which reaches a climax with the song ""Big Man With A Gun"". After this, things slow down dramatically until the final song ""Hurt"" hits you with one big, depressing knockout punch. The feeling conveyed on ""The Downward Spiral"" is phenomenal, and it's a must-buy for alternative and hard-rock junkies alike.",
"__label__2 awesome book about Paul: Wow - when I finished reading this book, I felt like I had been right there with the Apostle Paul through all of his missionary journeys, trials, and triumphs! I felt like Paul was my close and personal friend! The author takes the basic historical facts and truths about Paul and weaves a story around it. It made me want to get out my Bible and read Acts and other Pauline epistles. (Which I did...) Although this book is long, please don't let that intimidate you. It is worth the read!",

I don't know what the expected life on this product is, but two years seems too short for the cost.",
"__label__2 Good new old-fashioned country: A stunning album that will appeal to anyone who likes good music - not just country.The only thing that stops me giving this 5 stars is the final track - lyrically not great.Aside from that, Kasey's voice is beautiful - almost childlike, blending wonderfully with Julie Miller's harmonies on The Captain. Other highlights are the upbeat Cry Like a Baby and the lilting, haunting ballad 'These Pines'.",
"__label__2 Wow, great action, and a plot with a soul: Finally got around watching this kung-fu flick -- supposedly Jet's last martial arts film. It's never fair to compare Jet Li's hard-boiled ballet-like Shaolin kicks with Bruce Lee's no-BS brute-force chops, and both movies are extremely entertaining each in its own ways. ""Fearless"" features great Jet Li kung-fu action, yet it also has a ""soul,"" so to speak: the plot reveals the frustrations and dejections of a people beaten down by foreign ""devils,"" and a populace yearning to regain its lost respect and past glory. It's surprising to this viewer that the portrayal of the Japanese fighter is very sympathetic, unlike Bruce Lee's or other Chinese-vs.-Japanese fist-fight films. The special effects are rather superfluous but overall does not hurt the film's imagery or flow. A really entertaining and enjoyable movie, indeed.",
"__label__1 signal problems: This is one of the worst wireless systems I have ever used/purchased. I purchased this to use with my high school music program, but there was so much static, interference, white noise, lost signals, etc. that is unusable. I even returned it to VocoPro for a replacement, hoping the one I got was defective. The replacement was just as bad. Even after placing the reciever less than 10 feet from the microphones, the problems persisted. To make matters worse, AA Duracell batteries do not fit. They are slightly longer than generic AA batteries, but the added length is too much for the unusally small tollerences in the battery compartment. Even generic batteries have to be forced in place. I ended up installing it in our theater for our administrators to use during staff meetings because no one seems to mind when they cannot understand or hear them talk. Do not waste your money.",

I require a larger memory capacity, and a larger screen, so I got it here. The color screen is much easier to read. The 128 MB card and USB programmer are wonderful, and provide me with a set of maps for nearly all of my trips without having to hook up the unit to the computer for an hour or more for a half day's worth of maps.It has a couple of flaws, the mount isn't perfect, so if the car vibrates, then the GPS does too. The GPS V, didn't have this problem, it was rock solid. Nor can I alter the fields that are displayed in map navigation mode - the GPS V would allow me to change the fields, so I had miles to go until the destination - now I have to switch to the directions page for that.",

It constantly sticks and you have to use a lot of strength at times to pull it out and I always feel like I'm going to break it. You also really have to jam it back in and water sploshes out when you do. It is also a very small reservoir. It only hold enough for a small to maybe medium size cup. I like to make a large cup of hot tea, but it doesn't hold enough water. I just don't like it and would never purchase this again.",

Used them in nothing but standard-sized wine bottles of various common varietals. Did not place any undue pressure on them to insert, but they still developed hairline cracks with a few uses, which eventually lead to complete fractures running the length of the product. Does not seem like I got a few lemons ... seems like a flat-out design flaw. Too bad, because when it comes to their stated purpose, you really couldn't lose a stray drop of wine with these if you tried.

"__label__2 Needed perspective for a programmer: Want to write a brilliant applicatioin? Then think and process information the way your user will think and process, and design your application for them, not you! Easy concept to say and comprehend, but rather hard to actually do. Tog, through examples and descriptions, tells us how people think and process information. The not-so-surprising thing is that most code slingers think in conceptual ways that are not so common. Go figure. Tog really does help you understand how most others will process, and that understanding makes you a better developer.My company makes these chapters on processing information a required reading for all new developers that join the company. It is that good. The Intuition quiz, the one that tries to help you see how your own brain stores and retrieves information, is an addiction for every new reader. Of course, one of the coded sayings ""9 P in the SS"" is dated. Today it should be written ""8 P in the SS"". Tomorrow it may change again.",
"__label__2 Amazingly Lifelike: I grew up in a diabetic household so I have always been aware of the difference between ""people"" food and ""diabetic"" food. Of course it was only recently that I was put on the non-people stuff exclusively.These candies are surprisingly satisfying. I have a doc who says artificial sweeteners are for those who haven't yet admitted that they aren't allowed to have a sweet tooth any longer. May be true but these little candies are quite nice.They are, in fact, hard. That is a nice change from diabetic candies when I was a child. They have a decent mouth feel and an almost caramel taste. I don't catch an aftertaste. So, when I ""need"" a fix, these are nice to have around the house. Won't mistake them for ""people"" candy but these really are amazingly lifelike.",
"__label__2 We'll miss you Zachary...: I first heard ZB on the local 'smooth jazz' station back in '96 or so. It naturally stood out strongly because it is not smooth jazz, or at least what I think of as smooth jazz. Peter White is smooth jazz, with boring drum machines, limited tone, and just plain fluff. ZB represents the long lineage of fine true jazz guitarists that came before him, from Charlie Christian through Wes Montgomery and Grant Green, then George Benson, and now with the likes of Chris Standring and Norman Brown. This is real music, with soul and punch, and great variety of moods on one disc. It's worth every penny. I also have Laidback and Groovin' (which I found in a Tucson used music store in '99, after searching for a copy for 6 months...) They are both wonderful, full of passion, with a little bit of an edge. This music will keep you smiling.",

Inspiration-spotting really isn't a spectator sport, I guess, but the whole 'Harry was once in a boat, so the author OBVIOUSLY intended us to be reminded of Jason and the Argonauts' approach is just shoddy thinking, surely? There ARE genuine mythical and spiritual roots to the Potter stories - but you won't find them here. The fact that the disclaimer - 'not approved by J K Rowling' - was hidden in gold lettering on gold background on the cover design suggests to me (alas, spotted too late!) that the book is trying to pass itself off as something it isn't. A blind guide. For goodness' sake, hold out for something Rowling DOES approve - and in the meantime, let's trust our own imaginations!",

"__label__1 I purchased the first starter kit by Pelican: The one that included a travel case, 4 disc jackets, screen guard, car charger, USB data cable and a polish cloth anyway I didn't much care for it. The USB cable is too short to comfortably put the PSP on the desk while transferring files. The cable is only about 2 feet long so its only long enough to sit on top of the PC which isn't too safe because it could fall. The car charger is cheap because earlier today the thing burned out and when I noticed it the thing was very hot to touch. I had to pull it out of the dc outlet with a napkin! I'm starting to question Pelicans accessories especially since the recall of the power brick now this. On to other things the case holds 4 UMD's with the jackets on, but the two that go in the flap part of the case puts pressure on the PSP screen which over time probably could damage it.",

Not much is known though on how liable the sources James Risen uses are, since they were kept confidential for various reasons. Most of the blame is placed upon the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and CIA Director George Tenet; however, some blame is also placed on President George Bush. Personally I believe that this shouldn't be and even after reading James Risen's book I still believe that. Yes it outlines crucial mistakes that were made, but with the knowledge the president had at the time of his decision, those choices were the most suitable.",

That's why I was so stunned by the amazingly stilted dialogue. Real people don't talk that way. I don't know which surprises me more, that the writing is so bad, or that a fair number of readers describe it as well-written. Compared to what?! The numerous stories come across as intrusive, the author continually interrupting the flow of the narrative so we can see what a story teller Oenone/Jade/Nympth, etc. is, but it finally just becomes boring. Nor was I conned by his author's note at the end, in which we are to understand that what looks like a paedophile friendly worldview is just his attempt to bring to light the problems of child and wife abuse. Yeah, right.",
__label__1 This book has no sense of organization: This is a pretty disorganized book by any standards. The author seems to have no sense of what he is trying to teach. It would have been so helpful if he had just had the reader create a project from scratch. Instead he jumps from from one topic to the next and then back again. If you want to learn Oracle dont buy this book. The best thing that I can say about this book is that it may serve as a solid reference after you have mastered Oracle.,
"__label__2 Incredible epic ""kids"" show - who wouldn't love it?: We don't have cable, so my daughter stumbled upon this at grandma's house. And then she got the first two (individual) DVDs of season one. I AM HOOKED! The animation is superb! And the fight/bending sequences are pretty amazing for a kids show. I'm limited, but when Aang was in Zuko's quarter's (Episode 2) and when Aang fought is old friend (Episode 5) were fantasticly animted. And the voice acting puts it even higher.What isn't mentioned much here is the music. It adds such an element to the show. It is simple, sometimes just acapella, but it is spot on and cleverly edited.My DVDs are very blurry, which I see is common here. I hope, pray, wish that they re-release it with a better version. I am conflicted because I want to give 2 stars for the product. But the show is worth more than 5, and that is what people here want to know - if the show is good.LOVE this show!",

The dialogue doesn't even seem like Binchy - I can't even hear the Irish 'brogue' in my head - it's all flat. The Ella character is 2-dimensional which is rare in a Binchy novel.

It's a good intro to the language as well, and is example-based in its coverage of concepts. After becoming frustrated with various reference books, I decided to look carefully for a book that would teach solid principles of OOP and also provide immediate experience in writing useful programs in Java. This book distinguishes itself by going above and beyond those requirements. The introduction to the emerging area of design patterns was inspirational. However, the book omitted treatment of Threads and Networking in favor of ""miscellaneous"" topics like RMI and JDBC, and particular applications that illustrate the principles of design patterns like Fast Fourier Transform and printing. Not a complete reference, but as an introduction to some very important software design concepts it cannot be beat by other books that try to cover the entire language.",

Excuse me, that is not the Ranger of any of the other books. 11 previous books make him the super competent, enigmatic character that no one can trace and now all of a sudden, this store clerk has been stalking him for months and he didn't know that they guy was screwing with his life, his credit, his name and kidnapping his kid? I don't expect these to be plausible, but at least be consistent. I was disappointed.",

First of all the beaters do not have a shaft going throiugh the middle and a tiny bolt holds them together at the bottom. This seems to weaken the beaters. I tried to cream butter and it threw the butter out of the bowl in chunks. It was sooooo bad. I was very digusted at how badly it preformed...... nothing like the older mixmasters. I took it back and ordered some older models from Ebay to give as gifts for my kids. Even the refurbished ones that are from the 40s or 50s would definately be better to purchase than this terrible, but attractive piece of work! ...",

They lasted many years and made excellent coffee. When I found the 12-cup I did not hesitate, I bought one. Before six months,I began to notice the coffee was getting weaker. Finally, the coffee would be ready in minutes,but very weak. At the end it brewed in seconds. The water was tinted light brown and was barely warm. Since then I have read reviews of others experiencing similar problems. Of course, the dept. store would not let me return it. It ended up in the garbage. I would encourage others to consider other brands. Farberware seems to have let their quality take a huge nose dive.",

"__label__2 Biber with Affekt: I've found myself listening repeatedly to this disk. I'm already a convinced Biber fan (I enjoy his quirkiness, which no doubt is what puts off some reviewers). This performance is not only lively it also allows you to fix on the fascinating sound world of scordatura strings (including the viola d'amore), giving a slightly other-wordly sonority from the opening Sonata of Partia I. The RFC understand very well that Baroque music is all about rhetorical gestures (""Affekten""). They have the benefit of a powerful church organ and a large choice of plucked and bowed continuo instruments (harp, theorbo, guitar, gamba, cello, ...) and they play with a virtuosity that's absolutely appropriate for this music. If you come across this disk, get a copy.",
"__label__2 I love it!: I absolutely love Bear Naked Fruit and Nut blend. I was reluctant to try it, but I am so glad I did. The oats and sesame seeds are nicely flavored and provide a nice little bite. The walnuts and almonds are big and pack a punch of flavor. I could care less for the raisins, but I am not a big fan of them in any setting.My favorite preparations are over some plain vanilla yogurt (especially if you add fresh berries), or simply as is for a light snack. I also like to add some other dried fruit to make it last longer.This is a great item for those with dietary restrictions. When I fast for Lent or other Orthodox fasts, I always grab a bag as a filling snack.I could not be happier. This product is simple, good, and versatile. Highly recommended.",

Wellington was both dour and very charming - otherwise he would not have been so effective as a ladies' man!I remember going to the original widescreen version at the Odeon in Leicester Square - a truly widescreen. My recollection of the movie is that it was significantly longer, with additional vignettes featuring at least two of the ""scum of the earth"". Moreover, I have a distinct feeling that the cavalry charge against the squares is far longer in the orginal version. My hope is that the DVD version when it comes will fully restore this movie...",
__label__2 First Day at Nursery School: Lauren writes:My First Day at Nursery School by Becky Edwards is about a little girl who does not want to go to nursery school because she is scared. Instead she wants to stay with her mommy at home. She has never been to a school. She has never met anyone or played with other children without her family knowing the other family. Her first day is the most important day for her and she does not want to be embarrassed. I recommend this book for kids who are 2-4 years old. 2-4 is appropriate age group because most likely anyone older than 4 has gone through their first day of school. I was about 3 when my mom first read this book to me. I was nervous for my first day of school just like the little girl. I give My First Day at Nursery School by Becky Edwards a 4 out of 5 rating. Will the girl like nursery school? Or will she want to go home? Read My First Day at Nursery School to find out.,

"__label__1 Hi!: Yo, I hate the band N'SUCK and I really don't want you to buy this cd. After reading the review stating what you REALLY get (it actually helped me), I have come to the conclusion that I needed to write a bad review (since for some reason this cd has no bad reviws and hardly any reviews, so I thought if I wrote a bad review, the overall score would acually go down *evil laugh*, because N'SUNC cds don't deserve overall ratings of 5). Moving on, I have no idea why anyone would purchase an interview cd. WHF?! Yea, dude, just chillin', listening to N'SUCK answer lame question where I don't really care about their answer, I just wanna hear their HOT voices, ohhhhhh! And who wants to listen to ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" I couls write MUCH better lyrics then that, folks, they say you WAY too much. If you really like the song, safe your money and watch the (very funny) Clueless episode where N'SUCK sing at that girls birthday party (I havn't watched Clueless in a LONG time). PEACE OUT!",
"__label__2 Another excellent album from a band who keeps getting better: ""This Desert Life"", the newest album from The Counting Crows, seems to bring together everything that fans love about the band, Adam's dense, and incredibly meaningful lyrics, a multitude of instruments, and some wonderful harmony all have a chance to showcase themselves. Old themes, like 'Anna' and 'Maria' surface again, and are joined by 'Amy'. My overarching impression of this album as compared to the others is much happier. 'August and Everything After' seemed to swirl around losing yourself by making yourself a household name. 'Recovering the Satellites' was very dark. 'This Desert Life' is more upbeat, and had (to my ears at least) hints of CSNY (see 'Four Days')and the Black Crows (see 'Kid Things', the bonus track). I am hoping that the band will keep experimenting with musical styles (they cover a LOT of ground here), and instrumentation in the future. All in all, a wonderful album for CC fans out there.",

I was on the fence due to the reviews being so mixed so I decided to check it out from my local library, I'm glad I did because it was not as I expected. I think this video is geared towards smaller children learning the alphabet rather then elementary school children learning phonics or to read.

"__label__1 Very tedious read: I purchased this book to learn more about early Roman history prior to a trip planned later this year. This is one of the most tedious reading experiences I have ever had! It provides limited background and understanding to the culture, and instead is a boring composite of internal issues between several primary characters - none of whom are developed to the point that I cared about them. Dealing with the 3-4 word Latin names for each character (many of which were almost identical), added to the torment. I rarely do not finish a book - but after 600+ pages, I give! And unfortunately, I asked for (and received) the entire series for Christmas. What a waste!",

I have been using it for 3 months already, and thankfully, my baby is still exclusively breastfed.Though I find the pump is really noisy with the loud humming sound (so I guess my co-workers using the next cubicle will know what I am doing), and does not work as well by using batteries: with slightly weaker suction, and the power runs out really quickly, that's the best electric pump in the market that I can find.

It was well acted, and I like how they went back to the art over film style (as was done with a movie back in the 80's....I think it was Lord of the Rings, or The Hobbit, or something like that).

Inside the bag, the alarm had a piece of corrugated cardboard backing and piece of thin red plastic to cover the alarm from dust. The red cover was abraded/torn in two places and the battery compartment was hanging open. Therefore there was little to protect the device from damage. The baggy with the alarm was placed inside an oversized box with inadequate padding as well. They used two strips of AirPlus bagged air pods which were 75% deflated. Thus no real protection... plus the oversized box was crushed and torn open on one corner.

Rarely does a novel hit such a range of emotions in a reader (at least in my case) as did Egolf's book. I found myself hating and rooting for major and insignificant characters alike from beginning to end. Tradgedy of biblical proportions became uncommonly comic throughout the novel. To which made a highly enjoyable suprise. I chanced upon LOTB in a new writer's section at a local bookstore. What I consider a find should be read by all who find themselves lucky enough to find themselves readers.,

"__label__1 Disappointing: Overall, I am very disappointed with this book. I will be teaching a high school creative writing class and I was looking for books that would guide me. The activities are very basic - they would probably work better for elementary and junior high students. The main source of disappointment is the lack of substantial content. The book is only 69 pages (with a lot of blank space on each page). I would have been happy to spend $3-4 on this, but $18 seems like a complete rip off.",
"__label__2 Bishop, you have never written with such abandon and urgency: Bishop, You are so right about the original Christian spirit and the state of Christianity today. Your books always leave me breathless and open to God in new and renewed spiritual ways. They say everything that needs to be said and brought out into the open. Your writing here shows that you are determined to do all that you can to keep Christ in our hearts in a realistic way for the twenty-first century. I have never seen you write with such abandon and urgency. What can I do to help?",

However, more than half the book is about maintaining relationships with existing customers and how to ""win"" back lost customers. Review the table of contents by clicking on ""Look Inside This Book."" Only 1/3 of the book (30-45 pages, tops) is about winning ""New"" customers. Even the material actually devoted to new customer acquisition is remedial. I suspect that the other reviewers are friends of the author. Overall grade: F-.",
"__label__1 Terrible product...buyers beware!: This has to be the absolute worst software I've ever purchased, no kidding. I wish i could give it a negative star rating, one star is way to much for this piece of junk. The firewall is a joke, even when you tell it to allow an action and remember, it keeps asking over and over until you just have to turn the stupid thing off. It doesn't block any pop-ups, can't update virus definitions. Actually, it doesn't seem to do anything except add frustration and irritation to computing. Thanks Mcafee, from another customer you cheated out of $69.95 plus tax. If you want a good firewall, download ZoneAlarm...it's free. Also, PC-cillin is a good antivirus program and and is reasonably priced. I wish I'd know these things before I wasted my money on this one.",
"__label__2 A chore...but worth it in the end.: This was my first experience with Faulkner and I was overwhelmed. As I forced myself to get past the first few chapters, I loathed the language, the names of the characters, the interrupted style. To Faulkner's credit, however, I could see the vultures, smell the smells, and commiserate with the [unbelievable] lot of characters. I found myself getting completely unnerved just wishing they would hurry up and bury her! The ending was a great surprise and earned the story a few extra stars in my opinion. Reflecting back on the painful task of getting through it, I realized that this book actually made me think! His style is unlike anything I've ever encountered and I'm a better person for having read it. Tough? Definitely. Worth reading? I think so.",
"__label__2 Wonderfully scary and entertaining! Needs a Sequel!: I love adventure puzzle games and this did not disappoint! It really is more scary than you would think and all without a lot of the gore that frankly sickens me that you see in many computer games and movies. Reminiscent of the older scary ghost story movies that can create a chill up your spine and many looks over your shoulder. Really engrossing and like many of the other reviewers I found it a lot shorter than I'd like. Please game creators, give us a sequel and make it much longer! I, for one, would be willing to pay the extra money!",
"__label__2 One of my favorite: This book was one of the favorite I have ever read. Huxley disguises the meaning of the book at the beginning, but if you give it a chance, you will love it. The story of the future in which everything has been sacrificed, Brave New World is about a man who knows about Earth's past, but the people created by bottles are ignorant of the world. The people are made to repeat a cycle over and over without knowing any reason for life. In savage reservations, where people live in the past, like we do today, one",
"__label__2 Good but way too much hype: When I heard everyone raving about the MADONNA DROWNED WORLD TOUR I had to check it out for myself. I've seen her BLONDE AMBITION and GIRLIE SHOW tours (on video) before so I was ready for this one. I have to say that much of it is hype. It was a good concert but it was sort of dull at times. The costume changes were'nt as great and there wasn't a lot of dancing. Madonna played the guitar here and there... that was new. The bull ride that she did in ""don't tell me/human nature"" was way too short. It wasn't even worth mentioning. Some people described the geisha themed segment as ""awesome"" and ""magical"" but I found it to be OK at best. She flew across the stage.. BIG DEAL. She did an air spin like a scene out of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON... cool. I thought it looked cool but it didn't live up to the hype. And what the heck was up with that anime video thing? It was weird. So, I was a bit disappointed at times. MADONNA DROWNED WORLD TOUR ends with her hit ""music.""",

Apparently Colorado flies are far too smart to get close to these things. I have not caught ONE. The only way these 'traps' are going to eliminate flies in my house is if the flies die laughing.,

Now we are listening to ""Turn Around"" when he has more than doubled his own years. And it shows that he has learned something in that time. This man puts out music with a message and from the heart. You can hear it in his lyrics. It may not always be the grungy blues from when he was a teen-ager, but what he puts out is good music. Good to listen to in the background as well as to sit and mull the lyrics over in your head.And if you ever doubt for a moment if he has forgotten his roots, hunt down a rare live show from this man. He masters the stage and puts on a show that will have amaze you... Keep it up Jonny.",

Pretty good unit for the price, had intermittent problems connecting to the satellite. Finally went. Called Magellan in August 2007, received a Return Authorization. They supposedly have a 14 day return policy. Well it is now almost November again and after numerous calls to Magellan still no GPS. They use outsourced phone representatives, so you can not be assured that they actually understand what you are saying and I have had a very hard time understanding them most times. After numerous promises that the replacement GPS is on the way and refusal to provide a tracking number as of today I got off the phone with them and started filing complaints with the BBB and the attorney general.

"__label__2 The real deal: Modern county music has lost its sense of melody along with its sense of traditional themes (Try singing along with Big & Rich & some of the every current stars). This is one of the reasons that Joni Harms is special - her songs actually have a melody & deal with the themes usually associated with country music. The other reasons are that they are sung by a lady who has a great voice & alot of enthusiasm, & the songs are just good music - they are not over-produced & the musicians are playing traditional country music instruments; no synthesizers or wailing elctric guitars. This CD is great & so is the more recent ""Let's Put The Western Back in Coutry Music"".You should buy these CD's because you will enjoy them and also to send a message to the ""suits"" in Nashville that we want our country music back.",

They also included the USB cable needed to program it, and since the packaging allows you to press a button and see a demo, they included a second set of batteries to ensure you didn't end up with a dead set.I picked this because I wanted to be able to control my xBox 360, but it also works with my Apple TV.Apple MA711LL/A TV with 40GB Hard DriveXbox 360 Console Includes 20GB Hard Drive",

She has another album (or so I heard) that I am trying to find but haven't yet.

I really enjoyed playing it, although I never made it past 8,000! And as far as people saying that after playing so much you start getting repeat cards, well sorry but that is with any game. There are only so many cards that come with the game, so pace yourself, or buy lots of games and alternate, that is what I do.

Looked at the entries for several people, including Ariana Huffington and Michael Jackson, both of whom she trashes while revealing her apparent jealousy and racist attitude, as evidenced by her description of Michael Jackson's third child, ""a white baby."" I didn't read the rest because it was such a pathetic excuse for journalism or research of any kind.I found the book in the Sociology section of the used book store.

In the present book he sets to explore the problems of Palestinians who are citizens of Israel, usually a lesser known aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to people living outside the region. Written in the form of conversations with ordinary Israeli-Arabs intertwined with his perceptive and honest reflections as an Israeli Jew, the book gives a sensitive and fresh view of the issue and an alternative to trite journalistic reporting. Although he paints a picture which may be discouraging, Grossman carefully outlines an optimistic path for a better future.",

It is a fun read and the writing style is excellent. I hope these authors collaborate on more books in the future. Richard, the main character, is apparently modeled after the LaCroix character Nigel Bennett played on Forever Knight.

The Supremes looked wonderful as well and Diana primped and sang her heart out, but ""My World is Empty Without You"" was a little too happy for the song's mood and I've yet to figure out what the happening of ""The Happening"" is. Johnny Rivers was incredibly stiff and seemed nervous. The song ended rather abruptly.

In ""Batman"" there are a lot of things to enjoy: good performances (Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson of course, Kim Basinger and Jack Palance, to name a few), good music, great sets, ultra cool gadgets (the Batmovile is amazing) and a very interesting story.A comic superhero film is not an easy to make, but Tim Burton proved to be the right choice in this film.",

The title track is definitely misleading, making you think that this Sum 41 going back to the beginning. I also agree with the other reviewers in saying that this CD makes the band sound too similar to Green Day.

I keep this spray can in my fridge and after a workout or a hot shower, I spray this mist on and it feels amazing. You can see it dew up on your skin for a few moments and it calms down my skin by about 50% immediately.

The size of the clock is good for a bed stand, kitchen, den, pretty much anywhere one needs an easy-to-read clock; and the intensity is medium bright (subjective, I know--the display's numbers never appear to 'bloom') and easily readable from across a large room. The display is quite comfortable on one's eyes, unlike some bright-red displays on similar digital clocks. I purchased these on sale through Amazon for under $5 each. If you order one, you'll need to buy a standard rectangular 9v battery in order to support the clock's battery-backup feature. This clock works as it should, it disappears in a room sans the display, and it has battery backup--it's a good value.",
"__label__1 It stopped stopping!: After 1.5 years, this automatic tea kettle, which I use every day, stopped automatically turning off at a rolling boil. Indeed, I came into the kitchen and saw a shorted cabinet light because of the moisture from the steam.

"__label__2 Pump is certainly good for the price: I don't know if I would call this a ""large fountain pump"". I bought it for our fountain which is a medium fountain with a 4 foot lift height. The pump arrived and it looked kind of small, I was skeptical. It does work, and certainly for $23 it's worth it. Even if it only lasts a couple of years its worth it. I had a much larger pump, that this Sunterra pump replaced, which moved more water than this little one and it failed after 2.5 years (warranty 1 year). It was three times the price. The flow is a little weak for a 4 foot lift height, but it is adequate, and if it keeps working the way it does now, I would be happy with it.",

"__label__2 Thoroughly engrossing! Historical Fiction fans must read.: For me, Noah Gordon has created a ""time machine"" in The Physician. In its pages I am transported to northern europe's darkest hours. I can almost feel the misty mornings and smell the muddy roads along which a ""touched"" boy trods, searching for his place in a threatening world. We are offered a well developed and supported transformation from the young man's early survival years to his life-making, heart-wrenching commitment to the art of healing. Along the way, we witness many fascinating points relating the beliefs and practices of Judaism. The historical points are well-researched and well-placed.The pace of The Physician slowed just long enough for me to take a deep breath - now and then - and jump back in! The ending made sense and felt good to me. So much so that I located and purchased Mr. Gordon's other books! If they are near to The Physician's satisfying read, I'll be very happy indeed!",

This album is as outstanding as it is eclectic, using so many styles to glorify God. There's gotta be something in there for everyone. James isn't known all that well over here (I'm doing all I can to rectify that!), and those who do know, adore everything he does, but if you haven't heard, you are seriously missing some blessings. My favourite songs are Jesus Lives, Hold To God's Unchanging Hand, I've Got To Praise Him.I've got all the JH&WAP albums and I eagerly anticipate 'Messiah' (due out 1 Jan 2000 for those of you who didn't know).

The characters in this book seem disengaged from their own problems. It's as if the author threw in a ""readimix"" of contemporary issues to get our attention, then copped out on developing the characters' relationships with those issues. The book's too short; the author doesn't finish telling her story. (What happened to the good old days of long, luxuriant reads?) Maybe my problem is I'm not black, fat, or abused.

NPTE has three exams. Giles though has four exams and visually it is constructed very closely to a real one, little if any question explanation. Bottom part you'll benefit from both. But if you're short of green go with NPTE. Don't know the difference between NPTE 2008 and 2009 editions though.

"__label__1 The Unofficial Simpsons 20th Season Box Set: Although the season has great episodes, especially the 2nd half with the transitioned to HD, this box set fails to include any special feature what so ever. First off, no commentaries; The commentaries are the reason these sets sell because it makes a detail description on the process on how the episodes came to be, both good and bad episodes. Second, no 20th Anniversary feature where the cast and crew discuss on their experiences on working on the show for 20 years. And finally, no intro from Matt Groening; it feels that Groening had no involvement on this release, thus making it an unofficial box set.For those fans who just want to see the episodes and don't care for the features, this set is a must buy. For the rest, I suggest avoid this product and wait for the eventual box set with all the special features, including The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special in 3D on Ice!, in the near future.",

Unfortunately, I tried this hair dryer 4 times, but just couldn't get myself to like it. I have naturally straight, medium thickness, color treated (dry) hair so I'm looking for shine/moisture and body in a hair dryer. This hair dryer gave me neither. In fact, I compared it to my old conair travel hair dryer (blew dry half my hair with the conair, half with the babyliss) and I found the babyliss side of my head to be much dryer with many more flyaways than the other side of my hair. The babyliss did nothing for my hair body either, and instead kind of gave it a weird square shape. All in all I would say that maybe this hairdryer works for people with curly or very thick hair, but if you do not have this hair type BE VERY WARY OF LISTENING TO THE OTHER REVIEWS ON HERE.",

They soon find themselves trapped in a war with street thugs, dirty cops and every other lowlife possible. The Hobo decides it time to clean up the streets ""One Shell at a time"".This does have a grindhouse feel but it reminds me more of a Troma movie.

This CD is not as good as their previous 'All Rise' partly because of the high expectations that fans and listeners alike have put on their second CD. The first few tracks on this CD is neither greater nor stronger compared to the songs on 'All Rise' (they're about the same) but it gets too weak and unbearable to listen after 'Don't Treat Me Like A Fool'. I liked 'All Rise' too much to be able to listen to this too much. (Lifespan in my CD player: around 2 weeks; 'All Rise': 1 month +),

However, the fit for the X61 is snug (as I wanted it to be) and therefore, do not count on placing any additional large-sized hardware (such as a power adapter, although a small mouse will fit) into the sleeve.

I mean, is there anyone in the world who hasn't heard such timeless classics as ""Time Warp"" or ""Sweet Transvestite""?This isn't an album that'll appeal to everyone - some of the tracks are pretty naff, but that's part of the fun of ""Rocky Horror.."". The only regret about this CD is it doesn't include the lovely ballad ""Once In A While"" (which was, incidentally, cut from the film). In my opinion, that was one of the best songs. Never mind, you still have a great album here, but you really need to see the movie to fully enjoy it.Jon.",

It's true, this way of cooking will require more planning on your part, but it was still a lot of fun. Actually, it was more fun cooking this way than other methods I'm used to. I imagine as I become more familiar with this way of cooking it will become much easier. While I've only made a few of the recipes so far, I have to say they were the best tasting meals I have ever prepared.

It took me more than half the movie to figure out who the characters were and what they were about.The special effects are cool, but so what? This Wiseman guy - is a Judas who is happy to participate in the degeneration of movie-makin, trivialisation of the narrative and utter contempt for the viewer. Caveat emptor.",
"__label__1 It was an attempt...at most: Ok I have read the book several times, and enjoy it. Tolkien is great. This movie is not. The plot jumps from adventure to adventure giving no time at all for anything to be enjoyed. What is with the American voices! Gandalf isn't from Alabama! The soundtrack is alright. But I can't believe that they put in that song where the goblins are chasing them with that awful 70's rock drum beat. This movie is only worth it for little kids.",
"__label__2 not bad: first off to the idiot who said his gun didnt work because he charged it all night. These guns come with a very cheap battery, if you charge it for more than the allotted time (2 hours 35 minutes) you will destroy the battery.anyway the gun.This is an excelent gun for the cost, it out ranges any of the CYMA guns and simply dominates in a spring war (i would know i whipped this baby out in the middle of a pistol match and got 7 people) Its magazine is kinda difficult to load and spills bbs out if you remove it before it is empty. Also dont put the magazine in without the barrel in propperly or the mag empties into the gun. This thing has high fps around 220 -240 (yes i cronographed it) The only problem is mine doesnt really work on single because it double feeds apart from that this gun rocks.",

"__label__2 Moffatts:not that bad: The Moffatts are a new (hanson-like) group.Yet it doesn't even fathom me to compare them. The Moffatts seem to me to have more talent! They write there own music , unlike Hanson. To add to the pleasure of listening them they are all adorable (especially Dave, sorry I had to say something about him).They also have more class. There songs are ballads that are heartfelt and could make any girl cry. My favorite titles ""love"", it made me think of the best romance in the world,my boyfriend and me. Now if a song can make you hear and/or see things beyond the music that group has talent!",
"__label__1 Couldn't get into it: I didn't want to read past the first chapter.

"__label__2 Smokey Has ""IT"" and always will: Of the more than hundred DVD's I have, this is by far the best. Smokey sounds just as good as he did back in the 70's. I love this man and his music.

He's a wonderful entertainer and I can't get enough of him. Oh, the DVD; yes! He sings ""Ooh Baby Baby"" like he never sang it before. Fans, this one's a must-have and a keeper and one you will enjoy over and over.",
"__label__1 Boring!: I've not seen the TV series at all. I saw the preview of this DVD on Last Exile (which is a pretty cool series) I was attracted by the excellent detailed animation in the 2 minute preview. I couldn't find a review on it so I went and bought it. Unfortunately all this movie has going for it is the animation. Which personally I think is superb! The story is sorely lacking and the translation must be way off, Heck I don't speak a word of japanese but I can even tell I was missing more to the story. There is no explanation to any of the characters nor why they are there except there deamons attacking Japan. No explanation on the demons at all. Plus the movie seems skip alot from scene to scene without explaing any of the event. To top it off you have an ending that makes no sense. You don't even know what exactly is happening. I advise just to rent it and if you do put it on mute and just look at the eye candy.",

"__label__2 Wonderful end of the book: What an incredible series this was. I still wouldn't call it perfect, but it is up there among the best 3 or 4 fantasy series of all time. Frankly, at least for now it would be 2 or 3 on my list. No, it's not perfect, but it was outstanding, and kept me going throughout. I finished the entire series in a week, and now can't wait to start the next set - though I may have to put it off for a brief bit while I attend to other things.As always, the dialogue is masterful, the pacing was good. I definately recomend this to any and everyone.",

"__label__1 Ripoff: Where to start? How about here. This is a prime example of egregious mislabeling. The first half of this cd had nothing to do with Alpine yodeling. It sounded like the same American guy on every cut. Badly recorded to boot.

"__label__2 Great Series: Transmetropolitan is a great series, it's filled with quite a bit of punky, quirky, and deadly sci-fi elements, it's got great coloration and it seems quite well written. My only issue with it is that the main character seems almost completely ridiculous at times, making some of the issues unbelieveable. I suppose if you just distance reality, and don't take it seriously, it's quite the entertaining read.",

I'm also 40 years old and not ashamed to say I really like Edward Cullen along with the rest of his family, even Rosalie who can't stand Bella. There were a few things Stephanie did repeatedly that drove me nuts being I'm a writer myself, but otherwise she made a good story and changed my perception of vampires. Mind you...I still love BLADE and the whole concept to him ridding the world of ""bad"" vamps, but I really appreciate what Stephanie did with the Cullens and them being ""vegetarians"".",
"__label__2 One of the best books for the mathematically literate: Over the last 25 years, I have read dozens of investment books and this is the best. (Ben Graham is a close second, but is dated and turgid.)PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS BOOK AS IT GIVES AWAY TOO MANY SECRETS!Successful investment means long term thinking, some financial knowledge and a little mathematical ability. If you have these and some discipline, then this is the best way to take control of your own destiny. Be aware that the book requires you to think and to take account of things like the assumptions made behind the mathematical workings. I spent hundreds of hours creating and fine tuning spreadsheets based on this book. Every hour was well worth while.There is no short cut to successful investment: this book avoids hype and gives a remarkable tutorial for the DIY investor who wishes to outperform an index.",

"__label__2 Great book--I don't drive anywhere in Colorado without it.: This is a very handy book. It's arranged by road name and by stretch of road--if you find yourself on, say, I-70 westbound from Denver, go to the table of contents and you'll quickly find something like ""I-70, Denver to Dillon Reservoir."" Go to that section and you'll find a small map, geological diagrams, and probably a photograph. There's also an introductory chapter that gives an overview of Colorado geology and geological history, as well as very clear explanations of geological terms.Driving on Colorado highways you see some pretty amazing rock formations, and visitors to the state are always asking about them. This book will tell them (and you) anything you might want to know, and explain it clearly. I keep my copy in the car, and consult it often.",
"__label__1 Lacks answers: I am just beginning to learn programming. This book starts out well with easy tutorials that you work through, and then gives exercises at the end of each tutorial. The only problem is that there are no answers to the exercises, so if you get stuck or just want to check your solutions, you are SOL. So, if you are a beginner like me, the book is worthless.",

"__label__1 Poor contrast due to reflections: I was not happy with this keyboard for one reason...reflective paint on the keys. If the keyboard was used in a completely dark room, it would work great, but the light from my monitor reflects off of the keys, resulting in a very low contrast between the keys and the illuminated letters on the keys. The tops of the keys should have been painted with a matte, non-reflective black, so that the blue light shining through the letters would be more in contrast. In real life use, the visual ergonomics are very poor.I think this keyboard is a great concept, but it was poorly realized. The light from a monitor reflects off of the keys, creating almost a silver look which is very low contrast to the illumination color.I also purchased a small Zippy Illuminated keyboard which is much easier to read. However, the Zippy is only slightly larger than a laptop keyboard and I wanted a full size, so I ordered the Eclipse.",
"__label__1 Scarey: I have never in my life read such claptrap. Heaven as Disneyland is such an utterly ignorant concept I'm at a total loss. That people read this book and are uplifted actually scares me. It's McReligion made real. I suggest books like ""The Tao Te Ching"" or ""The Prophet"" or even ""Conversations With God"" for a more fulfilling and reality based journey into spirituality. However, if what you're aiming for is a few hours of reality-avoidance and want heaven to be something like 1950's America, then maybe this book is the one for you.",
"__label__1 Very Disappointed: Out of the 28 stories in this book, I found only about 5 to be well-written and humorous. The majority of the rest consisted of stories about intimate bodily fluids and functions that just happened to occur on foreign soil, and frankly, I found them disgusting and boring. After a while, I started skipping stories entirely after reading the first paragraph or two and seeing where they were headed. I was very disappointed.If you enjoy travel narratives, a much better compilation of women's stories can be found in ""A Woman's Passion for Travel"" edited by Marybeth Bond & Pamela Michael. Although that book doesn't claim to be a collection of funny stories, ""Sand in my Bra"" really isn't a collection of funny stories, either.",
__label__1 Doesn't provide a useful description of the movements: I've been taking T'ai Chi classes for several months and I bought this book hoping that it would supplement my instruction. I have an excellent teacher but there are so many elements to each movement that I thought it would help to have static images that I could examine at my leisure. I haven't found this book useful in that respect. The main problem is that it's not clear how the pictures relate to the written descriptions of the movements. Even for sections of the form that I know very well I am often unable to figure out which movement the pictures are trying to convey.,

Being a Blues enthusiast, I couldn't wait to add this to my iPod. Merle Haggard's ""Courage Mom"" is also missing. What I'd like to know is where are these treasures locked up?

Also, I ended up having to put in under the fitted sheet because it got bunched up so much when she was sleeping. Kinda defeats the purpose of just being able to pull it off quickly in the middle of the night.

I have been unable to find those restrictions mentioned anywhere inthe literature.

However, I find Muse's Shobiz to be a fairly consistent album and the band itself musically talented. You will not find the typical CD formula here, where 2 or 3 tracks are radio-worthy and the rest of the album is fluff or ""filler"" material. If you find yourself enjoying the sample audio, you can expect the same quality on all tracks. I hesitated using the term ""radio-worthy"" to describe Showbiz because these tracks will never ride the American airwaves. The only downside to Showbiz is that it's one of those albums you tend to get bored with if you listen to it too often. However, I just dusted mine off and am currently enjoying it again.",

You will also find frightening the utter boredom we experienced, watching three immature teenagers babble and scream and the babble some more for 87 minutes. I highly recommend ""The Watching of Blair Witch Project."" If you're at all interested in seeing the original film, Blair Witch Project, I'll give you a dollar to take mine far far away from my video library. The used DVD stores won't even take it from me.",
"__label__2 This lady sings the Blues!: Shemekia can belt them out with the best of them. I first got ""Wicked"" and knew she was a young singer with a voice that had the power of the older more experienced female blues singers. When I got Turn the Heat Up, her earlier Cd, I was impressed with her vocal range, her gospel feel, R&B , all around blues. Shemekia is going to be a force on the blues scene so take notice! Congratulations on your Handy awards, we will be hearing more and more of you Shemekia! I would give this a 4 1/2 star rating if there was one. Her potential is still climbing, there is great stuff to come.",

But thanks to truly shoddy manufacturing, our Pooh came with his back seam completely unsewn. Not loose or unraveled, mind you, this poor doll's back was never touched by a needle and thread.

I own or have read many others that don't cover the basics or the thought processes behind writing in a scripting language. Most books on this topic started out over my head with little explaination and were accompanied by buggy and/or old code. With clear and consice writing, Philip uses the first half of the book to fully explain programming concepts as they pertain to scripting in Flash, and then follows up with examples of how to implement these ideas.I can't say enough about how far this book has taken me into the scripting world.

We were so dissapointed. After buying the tank and then having to buy the tadpoles I thought it was wrong to charge us for the tadpoles in the first place!! So we ended up going to the river nearby and catching our own. That was very fun. The tadpoles lasted about a month...then I decided back to the river they go beacause it STUNK sooo bad!!

"__label__2 A prophetic look at the U.S. in Indochina: On second reading 40-plus years after original publication, Graham Greene's short and masterful novel ""The Quiet American"" seems profound and prophetic. (To many of us it seemed arrogant, stereotyped and anti-American in 1957). Alden Pyle, the quiet American,has been said by Greene biographers to be a takeoff of Edwin Lansdale, the model for William Lederer's ""The Ugly American,"" a favorable account of America in Asia written contemporaneous with Greene's novel. Today Alden Pyle could be seen as a character based on the Robert McNamara, Maxwell Taylor, Henry Cabot Lodge or Robert Komer of the 1960s. Greene's moral vision is as keen here as in any of his novels.",

Of Reznor's three albums this is my very favorite. Definetly worth 6 stars! An Album is like a puzzle. It can be put together right and make something beautiful that you can be proud of, or it can be put together to make the ugliest worst looking thing ever seen. Reznor is a master at making an album flow but at the same time each track sounds different, unlike Pearl Jam and their wannabe followers!",

He seems to have learned a bit about how a humane version of capitalism could work. For that reason alone the book should be required reading for all rah-rah American free marketeers. Much of the rest of the book is immediately forgettable. I was very disappointed with the chapter on Wall Street, a very lazy reporting job, and not at all witty.",

I could not tell from the description if it did this. When I assembled it which was realatively easy even with my arthritic hands, it did not swing separate from the legs. The handle in the photo controls the verticle raising and lowering. The lowest setting is a bit high for the standard rocker recliner chair I use it next to but still workable. The highest setting is very high and it is apparent that this was designed to work with a bed that raises more than with a chair or sofa, though it can with the latter if a bit high. The bottom wheel area is less high than many of the tables I have seen but still did not fit under my chair. A good and solid product in all, but if you need the top to swivel without the legs not the right choice for you.",

This one had a 3 team no-holds-barred match between WCW, the Horsemen, and the nWo, plus Eddie Guerrero defending the US strap against Dean Malenko, (may I add those are the two best matches on the card) then you have a battle of the former American Males as Marcus ""Buff"" Bagwell faces off with Scotty Riggs in a strap match. Uncensored 97 you could say was a ""turning point"" for WCW as Sting came from the rafters during the main event and attacked the nWo after months of silence and sitting in the rafters. This PPV was ok, I wouldn't pay 60.00 though, save that for a good and current PPV like Road Wild 99. This PPV is only good for the first and last match.",

__label__1 Wow this was horrible: Words cannot describe just how terrible this movie was. With such a top notch cast this movie had so much potential but fell so short that it was down right painful to watch. I must say in all my years of buying and renting movies I have never been wanted to break a DVD in half after only watching about 30 minutes into it. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen and I stomached my way through Zombie Strippers which was so bad I prayed for death. Do not watch this film unless you want something to base your comparison as the worst movie ever.,
"__label__1 Basic: Extremely basic with inconsistant layout. Entire sections will be printed with a blue background, for example, that look more like a special topics box then text. In several cases the text reuses its stock photos in several unrelated sections. The text illustrates points that clearly do not need illustration (Do you know what water looks like? There is a photo of it if you need it. ) and ignores others (the beta and alpha linkages of glucose) after dicussing them.

Yet I have to say, regrettably, that I think Lord of the Rings is grossly, grossly, overrated.The dialogue is execrable. The poetry and songs are (largely) grating. The descriptions are (largely) uninspired. Most of all, the characters are as tangible as a Ringwraith without a cloak.It can't be that it seems cliched to me (it is the first - and last - fantasy novel that I have read). It can't be that I am too cynical (I thought The Hobbit was excellent). It's just that this fat lump of a book is plain poorly written. Sorry, Tolkien fanatics.",

They have a good, solid construction and a very easy-to-use design. The metal hot shoe and locking clip provide security during use. The power of these flashes, coupled with the flexibility of the swiveling head will give you more creative room to work. The use of standard AA-size batteries (NiMh recommended) keeps costs down and eliminates the complications of trying to hunt down odd-ball batteries.

The methods in his book are fine if you are into wasting alot of time. Boolean and splines to make a simple character like the one in his book actually doubles your work. You wind up wasting more time cleaning up the errors from following his tutorial. Why he didn't demonstrate the way MOST people in the industry model, which is box modeling, is beyond me.

Its a virgin sound to your ears and to that asepc its a true treat. There closest compareable sounds are that of a Zeromancer clashed with London After Midnight. More so the later then the former.

I got a pair of Koss over-the-ear style headphones for use when I wanted some noise to filter in (flight announcements, etc) but I also wanted a pair to block out the world. The Sparkplugs did exactly that. The foam inserts expand within your ear to provide a snug fit that keeps out external noise. I agree with other reviewers that the bass is a bit lacking, but as has been suggested, simply blocking the holes on the outside of the buds corrects that completely. My only complaint is that after a while, one of my ears always got a bit sore. Might be because I have pretty small ears that all buds have a hard time staying in. Regardless, these are worth having. For longer term use, and for when I don't need the sound cancelling, I liked the Koss Portable over-the-ear set.Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones",

Homelessness is running rampant all of our country and the majority of the U.S population (270 million) don't think twice about it, only that they don't wish this terrible misfortune to fall upon them. But many of these people didn't take to life on the streets because they wanted to. The reasons are diverse.

If you want a good LP tribute, check out the String Quartet Tribute to Linkin Park which can be found on this site as well. As for this CD, it deserves to be smashed to pieces and thrown into a flaming pit.",

"__label__2 good janet effort: at one point I thought this album was the best CD I ever owned and I loved the music on it and some of it helped me deal with my own issues and for that I will always love this album cause it was one of the first albums I could identify with. But as time has passed, other artists have written better lyrics and music about personal issues though I give it to janet for starting the trend with dance divas getting personal too in their music. The music on this CD is really really good, but as a whole album it's hard to listen to now because though I always thought this CD was the most timeless janet CD out of them all and a good blend of old school and contemporary r&b/pop though several tracks are beginning to sound dated, it's still worth a listen.",
__label__2 Very well written: This is a very well written book on the subject of complex analysis. The text explains the concepts in enough detail that the reader has enough of a grasp to work the problems at the end of the section. The problems are challenging but not impossible. Overall this is an excellent book.,

Dr. More's fight to prove his innocence will no doubt have your undivided attention and will keep you guessing until the very end. I recommend this book to everyone.

"__label__1 I can't wait for the next one!: P.D. James is my favorite writer of this particular genre. In this book, I would have wished that her characters and plot had been tied more to our univeral angst. I would like to know of her tale of the common folks living very much in these times, especially those us living in but not of the world of commerce and the drama of rising and falling stock markets. I didn't care about any of these characters, even Adam seemed so one dimensional. If lives full of anachronisms is what we are about these days, Ms. James succeeded. Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps the characters of this book do represent the self absorbed, aggressors we all live with these days. I am however,waiting for and will appreciate her gift of a new novel as I do all of them. Give Adam his soulful thoughts back again, please.",

"__label__1 Chuck Lost the Feeling: This album represents Chuck at his ultimate low point. The songs represent a latin-based, mellow, depressing tone, which is contrary to his initial works. His trumpet playing is rather weak and cannot be heard in any abundance throughout any of the tracks. He plays a variation of an old song, Consuelo's Love Theme, but apparently drags it out to fill up space on the CD. The album is appropriate to help a listener fall asleep or in a depressive episode. None of his original band members take part in this release, and there is no resemblance to his earlier works.",

I think Zahn fails to set the apropriated tension since the beginning.The Ugly: How did Zahn dared to write a Star Wars story that doesn't features a dramatic ending with a light saber duel???!!! (sorry if I spoiled but I had to say this) This is not a complete story, it leaves you in the middle of something (nowhere in particular), it doesn't work as a unit like ep V which despite it is to be continued, it has a clear climax.I'm very disapointed by this novel.",
"__label__1 Okay story.........badly told: Anyone who likes traditonal Fantasy, be it Lord of the Rings, Shannara, or Recluse, will find this book dull. The story is fast paced...but I couldn't get really involved in what the characters were doing. So much is put on describing magic and it's abilities...the characters are not developed as much as they should be.I bought the first two books thinking the series will be good due to other reviews.

There is far too much interference by the inter-track comments, which results in an appalling lack of continuity. Why can't producers leave well alone and give us what we want - a performance? This is a vid to watch once when it could well have been one to view time and again. Don't they realise that all the rubbish added on is boring after the first time?>",

There aren't many books on life experiences with myeloma, especially from someone in our younger age range. Also, I have recently had a stem cell transplant and chemo, I'm now looking for alternative therapies to keep a relapse from happening and was very curious to see how Michael's experience was. I was disappointed in this book.I didn't really like his style of written, to me it seemed choppy as he was jumping from one part of his life to another. I felt like he included irrelavent details just so some of his friends name's could be mentioned in the book. Not to mention all the poetry and literature he added... it wasn't what I was hoping to read about. Then the book just seemed to end abruptly... leaving me with many questions and much disappointment.",

Clicker training with the help of this book made training fun again! This book among others also was quite encuraging!

I admired the way the author attempted to highlight the sometimes unwarrented suspicion towards individual people based on thier ethnicity.Although a fictional plot, I enjoyed the way the author incorporated true Macedonian history within it. However, I think that the quotations presented before every chapter directed towards the ethnicity of modern Macedonians would have been more effective if Aleksandar Donski's work was not exclusively used.All in all, I found it to be a good read.",
"__label__1 best part was mothers journal: As you know this book is the merging of 2 cross country accounts. The mothers journal from the 1950's was FASCINATING. Wish there had been more of it. The authors (daughter and husband) part of it was mediocre at best.Daughter and Husband do lots of complaining about Recreational Vehicles.

"__label__1 Failed attempt at comedy: Poirot as a comedy? Hm. Perhaps if it had been directed well, and if the plot hadn't been so mercilessly murdered, and if Poirot hadn't been as miscast, it might have had survived. Alas, it is a bizarre hodgepodge of sketches and spoofs, none of them particularly funny. I can't quite comprehend why a wonderful actor like Robert Morley agreed to play the role of Hastings in this movie.Overall, I would avoid it and go for the real thing - David Suchet, who managed to play the role faithfully, with charm and character.",
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!: My 6 year old bought this seat with her own money. She was very excited when she saw how real it looked (on the box anyway). It is defintely the biggest piece of junk we have ever purchased!! The seat cover never stays on. Her doll which is 15 in long barely fits (cleary states on the box it is for this size doll). This could of been made so much nicer. It was a very cute idea but awful quality. Fisher Price should be ashamed to have their name on the product.,

Among the bizarre claims is that Frank Lucas' collaboration ""lead to the conviction of three-quarters of the NY DEA."" Reality: zero convictions. He only testified against fellow dealers. Also his relationship with Bumpy Johnson has been falsified. Johnson's widow calls Lucas a liar and the movie false. These are just two of about a half dozen major distortions.

"__label__2 Beautifully Written: This isn't the usual type of book that I would read and in fact I found it incredibly boring for the first hundred or so pages. What kept me reading was the way the book was written rather than the plot itself. Simple sentences had so much meaning and depth, it really made me think. As the novel moves on and some plot finally begins to develop I became intrigued in the characters. Throughout the book I was not able to take sides with one character over another. Yet, I kept reading because I wanted to learn more about each one of their attributes and the reasons of why they did certain things. I was more interested in the character development rather than the plot to be honest. In fact the ending really fell flat.",

"__label__1 Hopelessly Outdated: Yes, it is a pleasant, lightweight read, but contrary to some of the other reviews here, this book is not ""somewhat"" outdated - - it is completely outdated. Anyone who knows anything about Ancient Egypt can just look at the inaccurate information in some of these reviews and see how misinformed readers of this book will be -- for example Thuthmosis III (the accepted ""modern"" spelling is Thutmose from the Egyptian transliteration, more closely Djehutymose) was not 4'6"" -- that is a measurement of his mummy, minus his detached feet and lower legs. He more likely was about 5'6"" tall, a very respectable height for an ancient Egyptian. As for Thutmose III being a ""hero,"" this is a man who, solely for profit, invaded foreign countries, killing, maiming and plundering, carrying goods and slaves back to Egypt, leaving countless impoverished widows and orphans in his wake. It is so sad to think that a mass murderer is anyone's definition of a ""hero.""",

Sounds superb! Second of all, songs are NOT chopped off half-way through them. It is true... these are not the 12-inch dance-floor versions. They are the single versions!!! But, they are not abruptly edited, as the other reviewer may have led you to believe. Ultimate Collection has a well-represented collection of tracks from Shalamar's discography, even a few tracks from the pre-Howard Hewett period. The cd does not get five stars from me, however, because there are TOO MANY selections coming from the synthesizer-heavy late-'80s. Perhaps 17 tracks on an album is too much of a good thing sometimes! Otherwise, I have NO complaints!!!",

At first i gave this album the benefit of the doubt and rated it 4 stars but after multiple listens it has failed to grow on me, unlike the great White Pony did. The album is just boring and overly noisey. Who mixed this thing? You can barely hear the vocals at all, they're buried under all the sludge. Some songs brake away from the monotony such as the explosive opener ""Hexagram"" which is as melodic as it is brutal. ""Bloody cape"" would be a good track on Around the Fur. And contrary to most fans beleif, ""Anniversary.."" is a wonderful ballad which almost makes up for the horrible failure of ""teenager"" on White Pony. The rest of the album just sends me to sleep, including the My Bloody Valentine sounding ""Minerva"". Overall, Deftones is a dissapointing album. It lacks both the emotion of Around the fur and the growing vision of White Pony.",

Larry speaks his mind, using common sense approaches and everyday analogies to show each of us that we don't have to labor under the banner of ""victimology"", whatever race we are.He states that WE are in control of ourselves, and that WE should be accountable to ourselves first and foremost.There is NO free ride in Mr. Elder's book, or his rhetoric.

"__label__1 Merriam-Webster Children's Dictionary: I agree completely with the one star review by Tom. This volume is a piece of junk. We purchased it as a gift for our granddaughter and it didn't last a week. It fell off her bed onto a carpeted floor and the binding broke completely. Since it was made in China, it's not too surprising. If a publisher is going to sell a large heavy reference book aimed at children, they should make the binding heavy-duty for expected hard use. From what the other reviewers said about the dictionary's content, I guess we didn't miss much. Next time we buy a book like this, we'll try to check where it is made first.In summary, don't buy this dictionary for a child since it's content is inadequate and its binding is junk.",
"__label__2 Gift from Across the Miles: This gift was for my Nephew's 1st birthday. Having no kids of my own and living about 5 states away, I had NO IDEA what to get him. I remembered playing with Fisher Price when I was a kid and thought this was very cute ( I love animals!). I read some of the other reviews about this product and found them to be very positive and decided on this for his gift. I'm so glad I did! My sister said ""He LOVES it!"". He takes the animals with him on car trips and loves to take apart and put back together the ark. I would recommend this product to anyone with small kids, and perhaps anyone not sure of what to get small kids as gifts.",

I must say that this book is one of the worst books I have ever worked from. The material in the sections is all over the place, and the examples are blended in with the material so you really don't know what's going on. The fact of the matter is, the subject matter in this book isn't very complicated. However, the god-awful examples and the lack of clear and concise explanations really drives you insane. Not recommended at all.",

This time-confusion is exploited to great effect, leaving the listener a bit off-kilter for a time after listening. Margaret Fiedler's vocals are outstandingly understated, as usual, getting lost in the mix only when necessary. Fun and confusing.",

Fun things they did on the side were playing christmas carols on the piano, having a christmas breakfast, the party, seeing santa at the mall and trying to do a secret santa though it was a disaster.

"__label__1 Terrible.: I loved their 2009 album ""Veckatimest"" and bought this one hoping it would be at least half as good, but it took me two months to finish. The lyrics sound like they're being made up as they go along, and then those lyrics are mumbled throughout. It makes for a very frustrating listening experience, hence the two months to finish. If you're a Grizzly Bear newbie, go with ""Veckatimest."" It's most excellent!",

"__label__1 disappointing: The Eddings have always been likeable for their commentry on the human condition via the use of archetypal characters that represent one type of person (ie, Tolnedrans are materialistic, Angaraks are religiously fanatic etc) What this book fails to do is to come up with characters that are original to Eddings' work! For example, Longbow is strongly reminisent of Hettar, Rabbit of Silk, Eleria of Flute, etc etc etc.Coupled with this lack of characterization, is an overall lack of oomf. The story just does not motivate one to keep reading - i only stuck with it becuase I kept hoping that the plot would shift up a gear. it didnt.This book offers nothing that earlier Eddings doesnt provide in abundance, and furthermore, it just isnt an entertaining read. The style is strained and unnatural, and seems forced.Save yourself some time and money: avoid this book.",

"__label__2 Beautiful performances flawed by poor recording: It is frustrating to listen to performances given with the care and precision that Robert Shaw and solists bring to them, and realize that you are listening through a ""fog"" of either poor mixing or placement of soloists too far away from the chorus and orchestra. Karl Dent can hardly be heard above the ensemble and the chorus' flawless diction is muddy. Renee Fleming's ravishing solo work is best heard through headphones because on speakers, the orchestra predominates. It is the miking at time of performance or something else that makes me wish this recording were reissued and remixed?",

__label__1 What a waste of a good title: Why did the author even bother making this a Holmes story? If he wanted to write a Victorian Sci Fi/Fantasy story did he have to use Holmes and Watson as his protagonists? Fails to capture either the flavour of the original stories or the period. In addition the plot is convoluted and required an effort to stay interested. I did in the hope that it would get better towards the end but I felt cheated by the time I finished.,
__label__1 Deceived and cheated: I ordered this camera case based on the description and the photos thinking that it was the same as the well worn case I currently owned.

While the fact that the original versions of the songs aren't all here (only Great Balls Of Fire has an orginal version of it) Jerry Lee is still bangin' away at the piano. For him to have been able to record such good re-recordings of these songs is amazing especially when you consider all he has been through (see the movie or read his book if you don't know of what I speak). I declare him the TRUE KING of Rock And Roll because he didn't lose his edge like Elvis did. The only reason I only gave this 4 stars is because I would have liked more originals also. But that's just my opinion and as Dennis Miller has said I could be wrong...",

Only critique is this version of ""El Paso"" is the shorter one, missing the stanza between shooting the wild young cowboy and heading for Rosa'a back door. I dunno why, maybe timing for radio which was a serious consideration back in the day. Might have liked the ""El Paso"" spinoffs that he wrote later, but this is a nice compilation for Marty fans, especially on a long trip.",

There are four buckles to tie the cover to the grill so that it will not be blown away by strong wind.

Just have to find a right place to put my grill so that it will not fall down. Overall, I like the product.",
__label__1 Amazon Michael Season's Thin & Crispy Unsalted Potato Chips - Sad news: The taste was very good on this product but I bought the 12 pkg plan and the bags each were anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 crumbs or small pieces you would only use on top of a casserole. No dipping or presentation wise nothing.However since I need unsalted chips they were worth a try and I need to cancel future orders of this one and stay with the Michael Season's kettle ones which of course were more durable and they too taste the same as the others.Amazon please note to cancel automatic shipping on this product but keep the one for the Kettle chips - thanks,

For starters the fields look as if they were rushed, The sound crackles when engaged in heavy combat. Now for the pros. The enemys can be like 20x bigger than you and you can be fighting up to 8 enemies at once and defeat them all at once, so it gives you a sense of collosal power. Some of the combat gets so heavy with tornado attacks that it is almost impossible to see what you are attacking. The dark tones and dim lighting in the game gives you a sense of mystery and danger. No matter how strong you get enemies from this versions feilds and dungeons can't be beaten with just on hit. For those you have played the first one the magic goes up to level 3.",
"__label__2 The GOAL: I had to read this Book for my Operation Management class at UNCC.I think this book was wonderful, since I enjoyed every page of. I believe that Eli Tolerate demonstrates his genius both as a thinker and as a teacher with ""The Goal"". As in any other well-written novel, The Goal examines issues in dispute which create conflicts. The operational concepts that he presents are revolutionary in their practicality and common-sense approach. This book is presented with a storyteller's passion for detail, while still driving the key learning points of the theory. This makes sticking with it to the end much easier, which is important, as several key concepts are not revealed until the final pages. Every organization can benefit from the concepts presented in ""The Goal"". Eli Goldratt has written a novel in which he provides an analysis of those concepts as applied in a fictional company. He has a cast of characters, a plot, and a context. He relies heavily on dialogue to advance the narrative.",

I got 3/4's of the way through the book and saw that the author was actually going to abandon a relationship nurtured through 2 1/2 books.

You start out with picking from four main characters, Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, and Gingerbread Man. As you go along, you will unlock more courses and more characters. It reminds of the Mario Kart format, but it isn't quite as good as the Mario Kart DS.

"__label__1 Just not that good: Disappointing. This book is not particularly well-written. Heller waxes majestically about the scenery and topography he sees, but I still can't visualize it. And he shifts his voice several times throughout the book, sometimes writing as if he were delivering sacred text, other times casually reaching out and attempting to speak to the reader one-on-one. It's hard to get a feel for the story he's trying to tell. Add that to the fact that there is not a single compelling character in the book and it makes it a little tough to slog through. I find that I just don't care what happens to these people. And this may sound silly, but an adventure book without pictures of the location is a bad idea. I hate to sound like I'm in 4th grade, but it would have been really helpful to have some visual aids to understand the geography they were in and the effect of the water on their kayaking.

I am still interested in reading about motherhood even though I have taken the plunge because I am still interested in finding words that describe the experience accurately. (It really IS wonderful but it sort of consumes you too.) Reviews seemed to indicate that this book had a revealing confessional honesty but I didn't find anything new here and it wasn't particulary well written. Anne Lamott's ""Operating Instructions - Diary of My Son's First Year"" contains many more ""Yes! So true."" moments and is more funny, and touching and beautifully written.

"__label__1 Too much about C programming, not enough about compression: This book's target audience is the novice C programmer who needs to implement data compression of some kind. The authors go to great pains to explain exactly how the code works, but they don't do as good a job on the algorithms themselves. If you are a competent C programmer and/or have any formal training in algorithms, this is probably not the book for you, though it may be a good jumping-off point if it's the only book you can get your hands on.",

It came with two pots and a plastic pitcher for filling it and complete documentation. I am happy with it and it works well but they should have included the spring that is used for cleaning it. The spring cost so little but I had to order it from another source. Ron,

If however, you would like to know something about the Gospel of John, I recommend you try another commentary. Carson is almost maniacal about defending Baptist belief and therefore rejects the sacramental teaching of the fourth Gospel. He writes in a chatty style, using the lingo of a pseudo intellectual guru. This is possibly the worst commentary on St. John that Eerdmans have ever published.",

"__label__1 Huh?: Was thrilled to see the box when this was given to me. As I read more and more about it, my happiness turned to dissapointment. This is a bare bones, barely flies gimmick with cheap stickers and cheaper electronics. It wasn't a total disaster, within 20 minutes we had this thing off the ground and crashed less than a minute later. The most fun we had with it was letting the dog chase it and chasing the dog after she took off with it. It worked for about 5 or 6 flights and provided an hour or so of fun. The 10 minute wait time between charges is a bummer and the minimal 1 to 2 minutes of fly time is a real bummer. But we did have almost 10 minutes of total time in the air and those 10 minutes were fun! The dog ran under the camper with it and was keeping it for herself. If you don't have a dog, you might want to save toward a real flying machine and save yourself the dissapointment.",

"__label__1 Need A Nap? Here's The Ticket: My wife and I had never heard of Norah Jones until the day after the Grammys this year when she carted home all sorts of trinkets. My wife assumed that winning the best pop artist award would signify a good pop album and thus picked up the disc. Wrong. Norah is a beautiful young woman and has a lovely voice, but the songs just have no spark. It was like listening to CSPAN with a piano. I can only assume that she received attention and overhype due to her father Ravi Shankar who was idolized by the Beatles (George Harrison in particular). But that connection doesn't make you great.I hope Norah ups the tempo on her next CD (it won't be hard to do) and maybe we can see what type of Pop Chops she has. But her career has Lauren Hill and Taste of Honey potential, so I hope she enjoys the success she's getting. I know I'll enjoy my sleep after listening to this.",

At one point, with just a few minutes to being finished, it was merging my old registry data with the new and froze up again. Very frustrating! Also, on a previous freeze up, the target computer would not boot fully, even into safe mode. I wound up having to revert to a previous system configuration. I would not recommend this program to the average computer user. You could wind up getting into a situation you may not be able to fix.",

It's very atmospheric but still it's unsatisfying in the end.And MORE THAN HALF of the stuff in here are boring essays and recollections of famous horror authors' own memorable Halloweens.One has to wonder how they make a decent living from their imaginations if these are the most vivid memories of their real lives.The book is really dreck and I suggest anyone looking for something to get really in the Halloween mood (re: seriously scared) give this thing a pass.",

"__label__1 MUSH: ...A Prayer For Owen Meany was a transcendental experience as anovel. Yes, this movie needs to be taken on its own terms as aseparate entity, and in doing so, it is a decidedly mixed bag. The character of Simon Birch rips your heart out not because of the weak and soppy screenplay, but because the small actor playing him is so frail looking and sad as a human being. This movie is shameless in its use of him, and successfully garners some lumps in the throat as the movie soppily explores one of the least interesting episodes from the novel. The character of Joe is given way too much emphasis in this version; everything seems calculated and designed to pull your heartstrings. Though there are a few genuine laughs (which come directly from John Irving's skewed life-view as set in the novel), this movie lambasts you with way too much autumnal color and weepy, bombastic music swelling on the soundtrack. Forgettable. END",

Pink Floyd, yes; Air, yes; Radiohead's Kid A -- most definitely. Like that album, this one maintains a somber mood throughout, adding sustained keyboard chords and echoey guitar to mostly murmured vocals. There are less electronic beats here than on Kid A, but they do appear on a couple of the instrumentals. Overall the album is a bit too sleepy for my tastes, with few strong melodies, and it certainly doesn't add much to what Radiohead already added to Pink Floyd.",

Basically it was shot, dead, kaput, trash it. Long story short, I fixed it by taking it apart and re-soldering components.

Both trays were great at keeping food warm, and more than one guest swore they were going to rush off and buy them as well. They clean up easily and were the hits of the party. My one complaint is that on the temperature dial, the ""off"" setting does not work. The only way to turn the unit off is to unplug it from the wall. (It seems to work fine on the 3-tray unit so it's apparently a fluke.) Still, I'm not the type to leave heating appliances plugged in when not in use to begin with, so I'm not overly concerned. You probably shouldn't leave these running unattended in the first place. Fabulous purchases and highly recommended.",

"__label__2 Truly One of the Finest American Movies!: I have to agree with the majority of reviewers who rave about this film. The story of one night of cruising in a 1962 California city hasn't aged a bit in the 33 years since it was first released. I ""saw"" this movie several times as a kid, but it's meaningless until after you've been out of high school for a number of years. The cast is great, the script is great, and the music is great if you are a fan of early rock & roll. Ron Howard is a fine director, but moviegoers have really missed out since he quit acting. Young MacKenzie Phillips is fabulous. The scene where Charles Martin Smith attempts to buy Whiskey is classic. Very enjoyable.",

Matches my woodland camo outdoor clothing.If you are doing hunting, wildlife photography, or such, you will be able to get some benefit from the green mesh somewhat obscuring your European ancestry white face which is a dead giveaway in the forest, a highly reflective surface that tells animals that you are not part of the background colors. But a dedicated camo face mask would do better.This item fits well without a hat, certainly. It also fits quite well over my Woodland Camouflage Boonie hat.Military Boonie & Jungle HatsIt's simple but well made and there is practically no place in the world (except Antarctica or the shores of the Arctic ocean) where this wouldn't be useful in season. If you spend time outdoors, even on your (non screened-in) patio, you should consider getting this. Flying bugs spoil everything.",
"__label__2 Interesting and different: So often faerie plots wind up contrived adn silly; this one doesn't. It actually is very believeable. Eden is a midling sort of heroine; she changes and grows throughout the book and eventually becomes worthy of the title. But that comes at the end, so it hampers the story a bit. Hern/Hartley/Cornelius is superbly written, very strong, yet a touch vulnerable even as a Fane lord. The forklore is very well done as are several of the minor characters. Perhaps the wrong done is forgiven too easily, too quickly (except of course between the hero & heroine), but it's not much of a detriment. There are a couple of loose ends I'd like to have seen wrapped up. At the climax, I was crying so hard that I couldn't read the page. Not perfect, but an exceptional book well worth the read.",

"__label__1 Words cannot express how horrible this movie is.....: This ""film"" is a MST3000 episode waiting to happen. Terrible plot, beyond pathetic script, inept camera work, and the only aspect horrific about it was the acting. I cannot begin to state how vital it is to avoid this movie. It is a complete waste of time to watch and there are so many more films to watch in its place that can solve your craving for 80's slasher movies. Literally. Any other film would suffice. One star is generous for this piece of trash.",
"__label__1 This Cheezy Book: I cannot think of a last time when I've read such a mindless so-called ""book"" and fumed with such anger! I am not sure what insulted me more: the banality of the story or the ""before"" and ""after"" commentary by the author. Since the book is written in a kindergarten English, the author, probably, assumes that his readers are unable to comprehend the simplistic message of the story. If you are looking for a good self-improvement book that teaches you how to positively deal with, accept, and/or affect changes in your life, please pass this one and invest in Brian Tracy's ""Maximum Achievement"". Otherwise, you can simply ask yourself a million dollar question:"" What would I do if I did not feel this fear?"" If, on the other hand, you are planning to accept change mindlessly, as the mice does, then shut up, and be prepared to spend your life forever searching for your happiness (cheese) in a maze of someone else's making!",

The sound gets a chuckle from my husband and my kids each time I use it, but I don't want to risk stares from people outside of my house, so I never take it anywhere with me. Additionally, it gathers a lot of condensation...it kind of needs its own attached coaster to solve this problem, or to be more insulated, but it lacks in both areas.

"__label__1 Safire is No Novelist: I usually love this kind of novel, but Scandalmonger offers precious few of the usual novelistic pleasures. There is very little scene-setting, all of the characters seem two-dimensional and generic, and the dialogue is stiff. Here's the work of a man who's done all the research, and has the intelligence to cobble it all together into a plot, but who sorely lacks the ability to bring his material alive as a work of art. My advice: For historical fiction of this type, stick with Gore Vidal (e.g. Burr, 1876, and the truly wonderful Washington DC). Vidal may be a little looser with the facts, but he offers a far more satisfying reading experience.",
"__label__1 Complete fiction, not a biblical account.: Although the book was an interesting read, it was very disappointing. It was not a biblical account and missed every opportunity to reflect on the positive in the people who were the beginnings of the Jewish/Christian faith. I will agree that there is a lot of scandalous and negative behavior in the early historical accounts of the bible, but this book made every attempt to dramatize and scandelize while omittimg anything edifying. There was no respect given to the God of Abraham and that I have to say was the most disappointing part. There are way better books that are interesting to read, give an accurate historical background, AND hold true to the integrity of the Word of God.",

I saw both films at a video store that my grandfather owns. A Return to Salem's Lot was there. I practically wore out the tape because I watch it every chance I get. I practically wear it out because there is no DVD release. Shame. This movie has some great moments. It may not be as scary as the original but the film does have its moments. If Warner Bros. is looking for a cult classic to put out on DVD then maybe they should get this film. If they do, please don't screw it up.",
"__label__2 Some of the most beautiful music you'll ever hear: I was reading an interview with Jim White somewhere, and he was asked who he'd like to collaborate with. He answered by saying something to the effect that there are only a handful of musicians out there who are totally in tune with the spirit; hitting the very essence of the soul or something along those lines. One of the ones he mentioned was Anouar Brahem. I got the CD, and to say I'm blown away would be an understatement. Brahem comes from Tunisia, which has seen the Romans, the Spaniards, the Phoenicians, and god only knows what other cultures, sweep over their beautiful land on the Mediterranean at the edge of the desert over the millenia. Brahem conveys all that and more without uttering a single word.",

Suffice it to say that the earth moved. I bought Double Trouble's albums (yeah, back then they were vinyl) and talked about them to anyone who would listen. Then I happened to catch the last Austin C.L. appearance, as well. Pure magic, and how happy Stevie looked, what rapport he had with the audience. God, he was great. I tell my kids: There were three guitar gods: Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Eric Clapton ... but the greatest of these was Stevie Ray. Just bought and watched this video, and it brought all the amazement back. There was nothing Stevie could not do with that guitar. I also hadn't realized how wonderful his voice was, too... husky and pleading and soulful. Why, oh why, did he have to leave us so young? RIP.",

The capsule summaries have to be short, (or they wouldn't be capsules) but too often they fall flat, barely catching the essence of the film. Calling this book an ""Illustrated Guide"" is stretching the truth almost to the point of breaking. The illustrations are sparse, and aren't even from the cartoons themselves, but from advertisements for the films.It really pains me to be critical of the work, but there is enormous room for improvement.

The creators also didn't put into account that the aliens were hurt by light. Only once did the light bother them, and that one was already dead. The only reason that I gave this 2 stars was because the special effects saved it. The rest was stupid. My suggestion is to never see this movie...ever.",

The demarcation relates not only the class of customer, but also to the Aussies (Mrs Williams, Fay and Miss Baines, Patty) in Cocktail Frocks and the very Continental Magda in Evening Frocks. Enter Lesley/Lisa, a naive young thing doing a short stint during the holidays after completing her Leaving Certificate.We learn a little of their private lives and aspirations, and the attitudes of the time (especially how men and women relate to each other, and the education of women) are spot on.If you didn't live through this era, this book will make you feel as though you did. And for those of us who DID live through it, it is a wonderful time capsule - but with the addition of sophisticated wit and humour. Very good",

Also, the chest strap is too big for me (I wear a size 8 in US women's clothing, 32 in bra size). Even if I wear it as tight as it goes, it slips around.

Did somebody edit the book as to make it more structured? Is Robert Jordan exploring his feminine side and oblitarating it? Is he writing only to fill pages hoping the quality of his first three books will carry him over a few more titles?

Today is one of those times. The Observer's wrist strap breaks every 18-24 months - and that occurs even with preventative maintenance on the band on a weekly basis. The replacement straps cost $40. My straps have broken for the 4th time. So, if you think that a $20/year cost of ownership on top of the price of the watch is a good bargain, then get this watch.

I thought about several systems and am glad that I went with this one. Would recommend this product to anyone interested in games of this kind.",
"__label__2 Reaffirm the giving the love you already have: I keep the copy of Mary Ellen's book, ""A Christmas Filled with Miracles"", by my night stand and read a few stories each night. I find that I can only receive, at one time, a small amount of the overwhelming emotions these stories bring. I know that if one purchases the book and only reads one story they will have received more than they have payed for! The teacher comes when the student is ready..Love and light to ALL",
"__label__1 Just awful: Plot? what plot? This movie didn't engage me in the least. And it also suffers from that ""jerky camera syndrome"" that seems to affect most of the movies today. I suspect this piece of tripe appeals to the anime, piercing and tattoo ""video gaming is a sport"" crowd, who still live at home when they're over 18. But if you have an IQ over 80 and work for a living, forget it and save your dough. Just pop in one of the many dawn of the dead movies, at least you'll care what happens to the characters.",

Despite our previous hilarious Mary-Kate and Ashley experiences, this film exceeded and went way over ALL of our comic expectations!!! Truly the worst film the two have ever made, and that's really saying something. Between their sulking because they've missed the class trip to Hawaii (because their evil dad made them go to the Bahamas!), their extended commercial shots of Paradise Island, their ... boyfriends and their ... clothes, this movie is hilarious...",

"__label__2 POSSIBILITIES: What this movie does is open your mind to the endless possibilties of the universe. It ""helps"" you break out of the rigid thinking we all adopt as we grow older. For those who rated this movie as bad, I can only say they were somehow offended by the thought that their way of thinking is wrong. This movie lets us all see ourselves in others -- not to judge or compare others to what we think it right but to simply observe and be open minded.",
"__label__1 Not value for money: The tape introduces 2 dances only - ""Cha Cha"" and ""Salsa"". In the 11min 30sec ""Cha Cha"" section, 3 steps are introduced - 1. Basic Step, 2. Cross Over Break & 3. Chase Turn. In the 11min 30 ""Salsa"" section, 3 steps are introduced - 1. Basic Step, 2. Foward & Backward Walks, & 3. Throwout. If I was able to preview the tape beforehand, I wouldn't have bought it. I many ways I thought it was merely an attempt to get you interested enough to take lessons at Fred Astaire Dance Studio's, because it was so, so, basic. Worst Point - In the ""Cha Cha"" both the lady and gentleman dancer wore clothing that tended to obscure a good view of the thigh and knee movements especially. Best Point - I guess both demonstrators were perfectly technically correct in everything they did.",

Oath of Seduction is a fast read with no extraordinary plot, but it kept me hooked from the first page to the last!If you are like me, looking for a hot read with a bit more than just emotionless get-to-the-act characters, this book should be for you. The futuristic setting reminds me a bit of ""Warrior's woman"" from Johanna Lindsey. If you liked this book and are up for a more risqu√© reading then do not hesitate further...And if you like strong woman with strong personality that keep men at bay with snappy retort, read the 2nd book of the series: Oath of Challenge (have a look on her website marlychance.com).",

I kept drudging along though, hoping it would pick up and appeal to me, the way Northern Lights did and the way Chesapeake Bay Saga trilogy did, but NOOOOOOO, it didn't happen and after page 200, I walked it down to the ""free table"" of my apartment complex and laid it there.Wasted time, wasted money. Both...huge disappointments. Going to start reading Tami Hoag. I hear her novels really move along, bringing excitement and intrigue. I still have two of Robert's books to try and get through first though ( made a mistake and ordered 3 at the same time ) and hope one or both of them will restore my faith in the writing style of Nora Roberts.",

She said she is a romantic,and that the characters are 'What we should be'.Just wanted to say that first.The symbols and ideas of the book however, arealmost impossibly real. Honesty (the best policy)takes on a different tone in this book, Self-honesty.The sex scenes are good, the speeches are long, theplot is easy to figure out 50 pages ahead of you, butyou don't know the end (unlike King/Koontz/ect).",

I paid around $30 bucks for each DVD in the 6 DVD. I wish that I would have known that the price was going to be so cheap for the whole series. I say go for it, you have nothing to lose.

"__label__2 My family history in a novel: This novel was written in 1889 and set in 1863 in a Sicilian fishing village within walking distance of Verga's native Catania. My paternal great-grandparents spent their lives in a similar village on the northern coast of Sicily. Reading this novel brought back my Grandmother's voice telling stories of the fishermen with variations on the proverbs, superstitions, Catholicism and village gossip of Verga. In Verga's novel, ownership of the house is lost through payment of a debt to preserve the Malavoglia's family honor. In my family, the two fishing boats were sold to protect the family honor from a false accusation. In the Cambridge Companion to the Italian Novel, Verga is written about extensively in a chapter about realism. This book is a delightful validation of social history in post-unification Sicily. These peasants were hard-workers whose family and religion gave meaning to their lives.",

I would definitely recommend this.",
"__label__2 Facinating: Not Fiction. This book is a presentation of information gleaned from interviews with women (and men) in the sex industry of Los Vegas. Its not just about prostitution, and its not particularly salacious. It is an interesting clear eyed look at a socially shunned part of living. You're not going to learn how to pick up a hooker, but you might learn who she is, what she's like, and why she's there. It fleshes out a stereotype. (Yeah, please ignore the pun...)",

"__label__2 What a WONDERFUL book!: This book is written with such a passionate aim: to help God's children experience the fulness that His Holy Spirit has to offer. How to Be Filled With the Holy Spirit is written in a very balanced Charismatic viewpoint. It reveals how to receive the Holy Spirit in a way that changes one's life and one's life for Christ. This is one of the best books written on the subject. Many authors, evangelists, and pastors just say ""God bless you"" and finish there. But Aiden W. Tozer goes beyond that. He tells you HOW you can receive the blessing. That's what makes Mr. Tozer an excellent author. Being filled with the Holy Spirit is a continuous process and this book explains that wonderfully. The Holy Spirit is here on earth for all of us. He's here to give us power and comfort. All we have to do is receive Him. In return, we'll be filled! Buy this book! It will definitely get your spirit excited and on fire for Jesus!",

But do persist.Whether you enjoy Stephen King or not will not particuarly matter, as this novel is not King style at all. It offers a realism not usually featured in Kings outrageous novels, a realism that makes you stop and think.

I have met Rachael in person, and she is a very nice person and has a very sweet and sassy personality.Sorry to say, but I listened to the album for a good 5 to 10 minutes and it almost gave me a headache. It's nothing but just loud singing, screaming, straining, and shouting at the top of her lungs. And it is very boring to listen to. Nearly put me to sleep. Almost every song on here sounds pretty much the same.I was expecting better.",
"__label__2 Great Military SciFi: I loved this book and most of the others in the series. Good action, characters with depth and actions with consequences. From a writing perspective, I think the first 3 or 4 are the best. The last two have a derivitive feel and lost the edginess of the first few books.I really like the universe that David Weber has put together here with the interplay of the technology. Space combat has the feel of the Age of Sail only in 3D (well, as in most such books, really 2 1/2 D).",

You do have a thousand options to work with the Z760, but it does require some basic knowledge about photography. It's not a ""beginner"" camera.One of the things I love about this camera is the battery life. I love my Nikon but I hate its batteries life. The Kodak Z760 battery life is just wonderful.

The same malicious synth-drive as Chrome and Six Finger Satellite at their most nefarious moments, and then Lordamighty that voice. Successfully replicates the experience of doing bad drugs with a revival minister suffering the pre-epileptic shoogaloos of amphetameanie-psychosis after several comprehensive ECT sessions in the Solitary ward at Parchman Farm in preparation for a public encounter with the chair. Not even Jeffrey Lee Pierce ever got this bad. If you get your jollies off by driving around in heavy traffic imagining running pedestrians down, this rates just beneath the Stooges for the soundtrack to your sickheaded little fantasies.

"__label__1 Not much new here....: Tarzan and the Forbidden City has all the usual elements of the formula: cruel villians, some comedy, lovely heroines, and threatening wild beasts. The first half of the book was better than average pulp adventure. Here, the pace moved quickly; the story's main conflicts emerged in the midst of Burrough's evocative depictions of the threatening and unknown regions of the African jungle. However, towards the end, the tension bogs down into a series of relentless and wild action sequences where cliffhanger follows upon cliffhanger, stretching the bounds of plausibility, even for a Tarzan story.",

"__label__1 Terrible: This movie is raved about by so many people, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why. It's terrible. Simply and plainly terrible. The characters are boring, the plot is simplistic, and there's far too much pointless profanity. Jeff Bridges' character is an idiot and a loser, and somehow we're supposed to identify with him and the trouble he gets himself into.Thinking back, I realize that most of the rave reviews I heard of this movie came in my college days, and not coincidentally, most people I knew back then were a lot like Bridges' character- losers, drug users, drop-outs, and drifters. The Coen Brothers are great film makers, but not here. Don't waste your time or money on this horrible film.",

For some reason the BBs flew way to the right of where i was shooting, so i couldnt hit what i was shooting at in the first place. I even shot myself in the hand at point blank, it didnt even leave a welt! Every gun me or any of my friends have gotten hsa either been total crap, or has broken before we could even use it.

I thought perhaps I put too much in so I decreased the amount and they still leaked. Forget letting them fall on their side, that's even worse. I can't tell you how many leaks we have had to soak up because of these cups. They are in the trash and I am sticking with Playtex.

It was a rehash of her old TV shows. I thought I was going to see something new but no such luck. Nothing updated in the whole book. Wish there would have been newer examples I hadn't seen before.

It smells like it is going to catch fire after 4 minutes of use too. It is a HUGE pile!,

"__label__2 A Worthy Record: As the child of Polish Holocaust survivors, I read Sara's Children with a great deal of personal interest. The author succeeds in faithfully recreating Polish Jewish life prior to World War II, including the gap between tradition and the encroaching secular modernity of a changing world. We all know all too well the ensuing horrors Nazi Germany inflicted upon Europe's Jews. The mutual help the Garfinkel siblings extended to one another, often risking their own lives, was essential and inspiring. If you read only one book about the Holocaust, I heartily recommend Sara's Children, Suzan Hagstrom's well-crafted memorial record.",
"__label__2 No loss for words here!: Ok, so he's suppressing alot of rage, but damn is this a good cd! I have not bought a rap album since Public Enemy's ""Fear Of A Black Planet"" in the very early 90's. This cd has restored some of my faith in rap music as a credible music form. He's not spewing out how rich he is or how many cars or women he has, instead he just goes off on, well, everything. But, Eminem uses his rage to create some very witty, surprisingly intelligent and savage lyrics which will make you fall out of your seat (either from shock or from sheer laughter). A bit rough around the edges, true, but he pretty much offers a commentary on how things really are, which we need more of in a somewhat phony society. Good stuff!",

Second, it's extremely hard to push this around, it just doesn't mow easily, it's a clunker. Third, you have to go over each section several times to get it even. Fourth, if you haven't given up and get done mowing, you then have to rake up all the grass clippings. I don't recommend it. We ended up buying an electrical mower. It's faster and easier. We also like the electric mower more than a gas powered mower because it's quieter and it doesn't use gas, two big pluses.",

I hated the characters, the plot was slow, the dialogue awful, and the bickering was way over the top. Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is a great actor, and, for the most part, that's evident here. But, this film is a chore to sit through, and by the time I did get to the end, I didn't care about the characters or the movie. Despite the accolades this movie has received, I suggest renting this film before buying it.",

Basically this album just grooves back and forth amongst hardcore, wild and desparate. A great sound in my opinion, and most importantly it doesn't disappoint the vast majority of their established fan base.",

I have used other ""Dummies"" books to get a start on a subject but this did not help me at all. I think it would have helped me to have some examples of how the pieces go togather. There are plenty of technical works on Frontpage to go to once one has a basic idea. In the beginning of the book John writes that ""it is assummed that the reader knows how to use the keyboard and the mouse"" The reader has to know much more than that to get a benefit from this book.

I'm sure Charles's talent was lost on the crass and puerile tastes of a Princess Diana. Long live Bonnie Prince Charlie!",
"__label__2 This CD is simply wonderful!: It takes you places you've never been, and once you start lisening, every bit of stress just floats away. I've bought it twice, but have given it away to loved ones because it's so beautiful. I'm now about to buy it for the third time. Bravo, Beethoven!",
"__label__2 Works for me: We got a set of these sheets (assuming they're the Wamsutta ones) almost a year ago. They do change once you wash them, but as time goes on they've gotten softer and softer. We like them and I'm thinking of getting another set for our bed.",
"__label__2 Extremely Helpful: I suggested this DVD to a friend who was very appreciative and had the following comments: ""This is a very helpful and unique rehabilitative DVD. The exercises are very easy to follow even without having prior experience with an exercise program. The stretching alleviates pain and allows for greater flexibility. An added benefit is that the combination of the narrarator's soothing voice, along with the stretching greatly reduces anxiety.""",
"__label__2 Simply Awesome!: This book is a great overview of the history and variety of travel trailers out on the road. Great quality pictures of all types of trailers, trailer parks and vintage ads. Finally, an un-biased history of the trailer, which tells the real story of how the Airstream came into being. The inventor of the aluminum aircraft-style trailer finally gets his due (hint: Wally Byam didn't invent it, he just perfected it and marketed it better). Also a great source of ideas for those lost souls who undertake a restoration of these beauties. Americana never looked so beautiful and interesting.",
"__label__2 I rate it "" Very Good"": Using this product with 2 handsets for about 3 years. This is not a ""Mercedez-Benz"" phone but certainly an acceptable, reliable product. One handset has developed a problematic dialing button, but you just press it a little harder (smile). Handsets work better if they have fairly fresh batteries. Range is good when battery is strong.",

"__label__1 Disappointing...: If you think ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" is funny, and that's the kind of comedy you want to do, then this might help. I personally don't care for that. I was just looking for something to help me generate ideas on how to think on my feet as a public speaker. I didn't really find anything useful in this book for neither public speaking nor stand up. This only seems to be geared toward group comedy.I don't know what all the good reviews are about.",

Conclusion, you are better off going to Karaoke night at the local club as compared to seeing these negative satanist nazi bozos trying to lure your son or daughter in into their world of hell, of the devil. the members are evil satanists.

"__label__1 Pitiful account of a soft drug user: I found the author's account of her drug addiction to be rather pathetic, to be honest. I too went through a time in my life, lasting much longer than her, where I couldn't get enough ecstasy. We called them ""dumpers"" for some reason. Yes, the high times were great, and when it wore off you felt empty and miserable. Blah, blah, blah. So what? It's not like it was the worst time I've ever had in my life. If anything, I had a good time having fun and then I grew up and decided what was truly important in life. Sobriety fits more with what I want to do with the rest of my life. So I quit ecstasy and cocaine. Big deal. It's not like ecstasy is even physically addictive, unlike cigarettes and blow. In fact, I found smoking to be much harder to quit. In summary, I personally found this book to be whiny and shallow.",

The plastic material was disintegrating and it looked like my motorcycle cover in Florida after being baked in the Sun for 2 years, but this grill cover was used in Colorado and was on a north facing balcony. I wanted to return it, but hesitated because a hopefully better quality cover was only going to ship in 3-6 weeks, so I wanted to wait until that arrived. Then this past weekend there was a big storm while I was away and it had to rip the cover some even bigger holes so that in the end it just flew away. $10 down the drain.",

I say untapped because for some reason she doesn't get the big radio push or the wide acclaim. But here albums, before this one, were the type you could start at track 1 and just let it ride.This album was beneath her. It was too easy and almost formulaic. Maybe the label, maybe the management and maybe Tamia herself was trying to cash in on the wave of forgettable artists and sounds that hit it big. But honestly, I just expected so much more and was completely let down.",
"__label__2 Best MP3 Player: I was looking at some stores for an Apple iPod a few weeks ago. I stumbled upon this 20 Gigabyte one that caught my attention. It was only $299.99 which is only fifty bucks more than the iPod mini which only holds 1,000 songs. This iPod holds 5,000 songs and is a very good deal. Sony's Mini Disc Players are good too, but they just don't stand up to the iPod. The outside has a sleek white coating which looks high-tech. The back is metal but the only bad thing is when you put your fingerprints on it it sticks to the iPod which can be seen easily. You should buy a case if that happens. They have really nice see through cases that fit snuggly on it. I'm recommending this for any one who reads this but if you have children it's almost Christmas time and they might be wanting to get this!",

"__label__2 difficulty posing: I ordered 4 of these. (One in each color) from hogwild toys. They were stocking stuffers for my 4 kids. However, after recieving them I couldnt help but open them up and tinker with them. I love magnetic toys.I was really disappointed in how hard they are to pose into different positions. The joints are really stiff and need a good bit of force and wiggling. Also, 2 of the magnets (one in a foot of one and one in a hand of another) have been inserted backwards because they repell instead of attract. Even so the hands will still stick together just at the sides instead.Other than that, these toys are pretty cool. I added some pics of my play time with them on my filing cabinet as they were doing some acrobotic rock climbing, haha!UPDATE: The magnets have almost all fallen out of the feet and hands of these guys after one 10 minute play by my child. They seem to be only held in by a metalic sticker. Hopefully I can glue these somehow.",

I have worked in a library and can count the number of times this book has been checked out on one hand. In fact, the only times this book had to be reshelved is when it was accidentally chosen and left for the librarians to clean up. The book is way to sugary sweet. There is no story and no interesting characters. Even the illustrations are watery and lack substance. There is nothing between the covers to stimulate interest in a child. The only function this book serves is as a therapy tool for severly depressed kids, but this might just worsen the situation. On the whole, this book is to be avoided at all costs",

""Having no meaning or direction or purpose."" Exactly what this story represents. There is no depth to Holly Golightly's character. She talks in trivial roundabouts, is selfish and did nothing but try my patience. The narrator is flat, a wimp, and has no backbone. The story consists of mostly dialog, giving the reader no sense of being there.

"__label__2 Revenge of the Geeks: Because of my limited knowledge of modern day space exploration, I did not know what to expect when I saw this film. After viewing it, I knew it wasn't just ""another space documentary"". It was deeper than that. It was in my words, a ""space age gangster flik"". I say this because the whole concept of pushing the envelope and successfully launching a privately funded space station under the radar of NASA & the government was just too smooth! Plopping down huge amounts of cash , putting it all on the line for the sake of introducing space travel to the masses. All of this & doing so ""privately"" without government intervention... well that was the plan. What a concept!Michael Potter's vision was truly multidimensional. Throughout the movie there was a consistent layer of ""techie & science"" but underneath the veil lies the real concept..Space entrepreneurs, space geeks, conspiracy theorists, or just curious, all have a place enjoying this film & I recommend it for your viewing.",

They give the impression that it will be a rebirth for him. But although his intellect and vision always give you hope that he could do something great, he hardly does on this disc. The first track is hot, the rest are lame which is ironic since this year's ""World According To RZA"" is probably the best Hiphop album of the year! Buy that cause it's sick as hell.

However, the mounting hardware is incompatible with those alarms, so I have to take down the old mounts in order to use my new alarms. This is frankly an enormous pain and makes me think I was a chump to go with Kidde again. I would have picked another, better brand if I hadn't thought I could use the old mounting hardware with the new alarms.I'm still not sure whether I want to return these or not - still deciding - but in any case don't buy these if you already have Kidde detectors in your house and you think sticking with the same brand will make things easier.

"__label__2 Best buy - convenient & durable: I bought this 2 years ago when I had my first daughter. I used it in her stroller on cool days and could quickly install it on the jogger when going for a run at the beach (where it's usually windy and cooler during the fall). It's very easy to switch from/to any stroller (less than 1 minute). When we visited relatives in Canada at Xmas, I installed the bundleMe on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot. In San Diego one fall day, when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet, she ended up wearing only a diaper but the BundleMe kept her warm as we walked back home. Never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road, or having enough blankets to keep baby warm, or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets, lost a shoe/sock, etc. I am now using the same bundle me with my second child. I'd recommend it to anyone who spends lots of time outdoor taking walks, etc.",

Mostly it is because I am waiting for my favorite films--LOTR and Star Wars--to be released on blu-ray. The *real* version of LOTR has yet to be released, thus I haven't bought a blu-ray player. This is shameless double-dipping from New Line. The theatrical and extended versions could easily fit on a blu-ray disc. That is the point of blu-ray!!!!! More space on the disc = more video!!! If they had released the extended versions, I would have bought them and a blu-ray player on day one. In addition, I might have bought more New Line films on blu-ray by now too. Instead, New Line has chosen to alienate me as a customer and not receive any income from me (not that they need it). Their loss, not mine. I'm still happy with my extended cuts on DVD.",

Yes, some of it (ok, a lot of it) is totally illogical. But if you can suspend about 95% of your disbelief, it's quite a fun read.Those readers looking for a well-researched techno-thriller based on fact should pass on this one. They'll just be annoyed by all the impossible escapes and situations.So, if it's so illogical and unreal, why did I give it four stars?? Because I read it when I was home with a miserable flu.

We gave the XL to our neighbor's son and he could wear it but it was also huge at the top but fit him at the bottom.The company got in touch with me after I reviewed them and offered me 25% off of my NEXT purchase with them if I would remove my negative feedback.

I would have given the book five stars, except for the items already mentioned in other reviews (a second autopsy on a body, the VERY detailed descriptions of what happens during a bombing raid), and the very intense description of the killer's home toward the end of the book - up until then I was reading each page very slowly, but I sped through this part - it really turned my stomach.But that aside, this one heckuva good read.",
__label__1 Feeds more than one page at a time: I am surprised to see positive feedback for this fax machine. Ours frequently takes in more than one page at a time when sending a fax so I aways need to hold on to all but the bottom page to keep all pages from all going through. I find this machine very frustrating.,
"__label__2 Rocked out trad Irish ballads.: The Blaggards manage to make even some of the sillier songs from the trad canon, such as Drunken Sailor & Big Strong Man, sound cool. Any band that can pull off singing 'The Fields of Athenry' to the music of 'Folsom Prison Blues' has it together. When they bust into a reggae groove in the middle of covering Elvis' 'Suspicious Minds' you wonder how far the tongue is in the cheek, but you can't argue with the singers Long John Silver voice and the flat out rockin' that goes on. The fiddlin' isn't half bad either. You can get this from CD Baby.",
"__label__1 The worst movie I've ever seen: With the top-notch actors and previews with awesome special effects, I expected an exciting film. Wrong! This movie fell flat. What's worse is that it's long. If not for the outstanding special effects and Woody Harrelson's role, the film is a total zero. Terrible writing, plot development and execution. Basically, a terrible movie.",
__label__1 Sent wrong item!: I read the reviews about the wrong item being sent and now I am one of those persons writing one. I received a cheap wall charger that had nothing to do with using it in a car.,
__label__2 Leaked but was able to fix :): Was a little frustrated at first because no matter what I tried it leaked right where the pipe from the wall and bracket meet. Followed the instructions and didn't use pipe tape. It also says to hand tighten only. A quick call to Waterpik customer service solved the problem. Simply use bar soap and coat the threads of the bracket and pipe. I did use a wrench to gently tighten and no more leaks. :) Also had a little trouble removing the orange water flow restrictor but needle nose pliers solved that problem and I was able to pull it out.,
"__label__1 She barely sings her own songs.: Mariah has one of the most beautifully gifted voices in the world. I love her new identity and the R & B direction that she went with her career.However, this concert is one of the worst I have seen. She barely sings to her songs, just adds styling in while her background singers belt it out. And the few times she actually sings her songs, you are almost relieved for her and for the fans that paid to see the concert. She rambles on and on in between songs and although she truly seems to love her fans and want to involve them, she does not reward them with well sung music.All that being said, it was watchable, but then again, a train wreck is possible too.",
"__label__1 Just What I Didn't Want: Go ahead and order them if you must, but the transfer to DVD is terrible. To get all the episodes on as few disks as possible, they either compressed them too much or just didn't take care in doing a quality job. I can't watch them in full screen mode without horrendous artifacts. So I have to reduce screen size to make it look as good as it did on television. I shouldn't have to do that.",
__label__1 you get what you pay for: For $5.oo don't expect good quality. My 4 yo liked it but got tired of it. It has 3 voice settings which pretty much sounded the same to me.The only thing I like about this product is that it's size is perfect for my 4yo son. Not really a good bday present ..but could be a good bday party treat.,
__label__2 FIVE! FIVE! FiIVE!!: I have never read a book in a day until this one. I just couldn't put it down. I loved Paranoia (another fast read) but Company Man was a little disappointing to me so I was skeptical of this book. Killer Instinct is a fast-paced thriller that readers will LOVE.,
__label__2 A nice pick me up: This book is filled with quotations and sayings to help lift you up. When you are having a bad day its great to open this book and find a quote that applies to your situation. The sayings are positive and uplifting. Something that can put a smile on your face. The book is small so you can carry it in your purse or bag.,

Who on earth thought that there was no reason to include an option to watch the concert without all these interruptions? I mean it's a DVD! You can do anything with these things! Sabbath is in fine form in the performance, it's just a shame it was ruined with the interview stuff. Go buy the 'reunion' CD instead.",
"__label__1 Absolutely horrible: I purchased this razor five months ago ... it's my third Panasonic in the last 13 years. It's worked great since then, until today when, with more than 60 percent charge, it just died. It won't hold a charge even after sitting in the stand for almost an hour, either. Ever try getting through to Panasonic's Customer Service line to exercise your warranty? Don't, unless you've 55 minutes to chill sitting on the phone. Then, when you finally get a live human on the phone, they'll tell you that the only option is to repair the product -- no replacement, nothing done to retain a customer of more a dozen years. To add insult to injury, YOU have to pay to ship it to a repair center!! Bottomline, this product is horrible -- this is a common problem for this model, regardless of what Panasonic PR claims. Avoid it all costs, even though it gives a great shave. At the price Panasonic charges, it's just not worth the headache. If I could dole out zero stars, I would.",
"__label__1 How can this not have Noticeable One?: I found out about Missing Persons by hearing the song Noticeable One on the radio. To date, it remains my favorite song by them.

"__label__2 fantastic value for money: Bought this re-conditioned on sale for $30. Best $30 I've ever spent. If you need/want a 1/4 inch shaft bit router, you can't beat this for the money. I have used it in a router table also and it works remarkably well there, as long as you are mindful of the 1/4 inch bit limitation. I think it regularly sells for $60, and quite frankly, I would not be unhappy with it at that price either. You're not going to build major furniture with this, but if you want to be able to do most other things that a 1/4 inch shaft router will do, this is an excellent buy!",
"__label__1 Would not recommend for beginners: I read the book first thinking it would be different from the CD. Then I played the CD and it's as if the woman is reading from the book. I was disapointed. If you understand the positions of yoga, this is a good CD for your daily practice. However, I would recommend a DVD for beginners so they can see the instructor and how to position their body.I also did not find the CD motivating. It's as if the instructor just reads the position to you. I prefer a classroom setting where I can see the instructor and vice versa. Instructors understand we have good days and bad and will provide more motivation.",
__label__2 I think this book is a wonderful book for children to read!: I think this book is great! I recently read it for my college children's literature class. I think she did a great job of developing the characters and really made you feel like you were living in their shoes. I think it is very educational for children to learn about what African Americans went through in the south during that time period! I'm very glad she won the Newbery Award in 1977. She deserved it!!!!!,

"__label__2 Russo novels seldom disappoint: The rogues, tricksters, mentally-ill, gamblers, alcoholics and ne'er-do-wells in Risk Pool are nothing less than adorable. Russo writes beautiful prose that pulls at every one of the reader's emotions. Here, he creates a cast of loafers with a dry humor that will have you laughing out loud at times. I've read six of Russo's novels and while this one wasn't my favorite, it's nonetheless a masterpiece. It starts to run out of gas in the last quarter of the book but by the end it's... kinda worth it.",
"__label__2 Where You Find It entertaing: I did read other reviews but found I had to check it out for myself. Yes the heroine Jennifer was a little controlling...I am woman I can do it all on my own, and part of me admired her for it. However Mick was the man. He didn't let her dictate the movement of the relationship. Okay she broke it off but I somehow had faith my Mick would wear her down, boy did he. The other charcters were wonderful support in the story. Her little girl who drew them together and her best friend telling GF how it is. Love when a GF honestly tells the other one they are stuck on stupid, it just tickles me. Well the book satifised this romantic reader, and I'm very pleased I purchased this book.",
__label__2 Great match up: Most of the time they talk about the great rivalry with Sampras and Agassi. But when Agassi played Rafter it was fun to watch as well. This match goes five sets and is and excellent example of strategy in tennis.,
"__label__1 Austin UnPowers: Did the Brits ever really get psychedlic music? If this CD is any indication the answer has to be no. Pink Floyd got it, but I think they're maybe the only Brit band that did. If you want psychedlic, go to San Francisco.This CD is a curiosity. It's not really psychedelic. It's more like bubble gum. But it's not very good at that either. This CD is for those who have large 60s collection that they've become bored with and are looking for marginalia. A spin or two with it may get you off the 60s all together. Once you get to this point there really isn't anything more available.",
"__label__2 The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street Lives On Today..Serendipity: A fabulous ending to over 20 years of letter writing. Penpals of sorts.

"__label__2 Fabulous: I read this book for the first time in sixth grade for a book report. It soon became one of the few books that would burn in my memory for a long time. It took two hours of reading a day to finish in time for the book report, but it was well worth it.",

It makes my xti look like a large pro camera. and I love the ability to turn the camera 90 degrees and shoot.I have lots of battery life. I mean lots! the camera sits in my case ready to go for days and I never have to worry about running out of batteries or recharging. I charge it once a month, and I am good to go.I also like the AA battery insert, instead of the rechargeable, I could go into any store and buy AA batteries and be ready to go.I had no problem securing the grip to my camera. I was just careful to install it the first time. I will never take it off!",
"__label__2 Greene's Greatest?: To start with, I am a Greene fanatic, so you might take my opinion with a grain of salt. I didn't read The End of the Affair for many years after I'd read virtually all of Greene's other novels. I love his thrillers, his adventures, his ""serious"" works. But I didn't think I'd love a book about an adulterous affair, particularly one with God and Catholicism at its center. I finally got around to it. How wrong, wrong, wrong I was.Having read it twice, I now have to ask whether it's Greene's best book. Every aspect of the book is unexpected: the reason their affair ends, why she leaves, who the man she's seeing is, Bendrix's response, all the way to the end where Bendrix befriends her husband.What in other hands would have been a simple morality play, is so much more thrilling. An absolute masterpiece, unlike anything else written by GG (or anyone else).",
"__label__2 About ten years ahead of their time: This album blew me away so hard when it came out--more innovative and original than anything at the time. OMD did have their own quirky vocal flavor, which may explain their limited popularity. Personally, I loved this album then and I still do. These guys were simply genius. I'm listening to this album as I write this. It's the first time I've heard it in more than ten years. It still strikes as intelligent and honest, with a waterfall of soul and emotion coming through compelling electronic sounds.",

"__label__1 Trite and Been-done-before: Yes, it's been done before: Add Dances With Wolves to the King and I and what do you get? Well, you would get a LOT MORE than this movie, but generally you get the idea...The acting is generally average, with the exception of the usual Tom Cruise faux intensity, replete with the usual faux intellectual/academic post movie interviews...As for action scenes, the audience get's to watch a slo-mo repeat of one sword-swingning scene presumably to show us how great the fist version would have been had it been properly filmed...and the epic scenes are, well, simply put, NOT EPIC.The lack of love interest is apparent in the apparent lack of interest in the female character by Cruise - no surprise - which leaves the male viewer with little more than some OK aikido, iaido and sushi.The only thing missing was a rice-rocket motorcycle scene. No Top Shogun here.",
"__label__2 The Best of Mel Brooks!!!!: ""Oh de Camptown Ladies sing dis song..."" I loooove this film. Some of the greatest comedians working with one of the Twentieth Centuries greatest directors. Mel Brooks turned what would have probably been quite a dreary script (originally called TEX X) into a work of pure comedic genius. There is something quite subversive about this film that he never quite managed before or since.Cleavon Little as Sheriff Bart is right on the button, especially in his initial reaction to the townsfolks bigotry (""Oh, Lordylord!!! He means it!!!! Do what he say!!!!!!""). Gene Wilder is at his absolute peak never missing a laugh and even getting some quite unexpected giggles from some rather mundane lines. Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickens... in fact the casting is so right that this is one of the most faultless spoofs ever made!!!!!!""...do dah, do dah.""",

Every time they shift or roll-over they make a horribly loud noise. I have tried piling on additional blankets and comforters on top, which hasn't worked. Additionally, after only 2 or 3 uses one of them will not hold air. These beds are going in the trash and will be replaced by something less expensive and quieter.

Earl's nobility irritated, the stereotypical mobsters and molls were mere window-dressing, and the backwoods hicks were ridiculous caricatures.I will try others by the author as my wife swears that this is the worst of his books, and I generally trust her taste. For me, though, this was a disappointment. I can forgive a story that lacks originality if the writing is compelling; this isn't that book.

Joe even colleberates with N'Sync, and not being a big fan of them, I kinda like this song.The standout's are: I wanna Know, Treat Her Like A Lady, One Life Stand, and the Remix to Thank God I Found You.I think Joe has another classic on his hands and I am happy to see him having even more success. If you like R&B and Keith Swaet and R. Kelly then you'll like this work, maybe even better. To all you current Joe fans go ahead and pick this cd up, it is another steller piece of work.",

Some of the songs the guy wrote are amazing. He was defiently one of the best songwriters to come out of Britain. His material on Badfinger's ""Straight up"" and ""Wish you were here"" are 100% superb. Perfect pop songs. ""Golders Green"" is a really good album, it shows Ham's songwrting and performance talents. ""Dawn"" is a beutiful Psych ballad,""Makes me feel so good"" could have been easily 'The first Power Pop anthem' if was released at that time. The rest is quite the same, Very Mccartney in total, similar to Mcca's early solo albums, sometimes even better.",

It just makes you want to scream out ""SPIELBERG, YOU ARE A GENIUS!"" I would recommend this movie to people over 14 years of age, who likes Spielberg films, and who likes to watch war films.

I was intrigued by the name ""sick and twisted animation"" Well maybe if I was still in my 20's this may have been a bit more interesting. But as an ""official grown-up"" now it wasn't. I do appreciate the effort put forth into the making of these shorts, but they were just sort of lackluster. One dog humping a stuuffed animal maybe fine, but this film featured 3 such shorts, which made me lose interest very fast. There were also a number of shorts about cats.

To say that the plot is lacking would be rather kind. Not only is it lacking, I have seen hundreds of martial arts/animes that have the same premise, and this movie didn't really stick out to me. Sure there are lots of dialogues and colorful characters that Terantino fans will love, but it just isn't a great movie. Entertaining as hell, but not a great movie. I hate to say it, but Terantino's best movie is, and always will be, Pulp Fiction. I wish it wasn't so, he is so damn likeable and stylish, but it's the sad truth.",

Nugent's early guitar work was distinctive, fluid and original, more refined than much of his later stuff. Farmer's songwriting antics were just as original, although his attempts at psychedelic ""deepness"" were sometimes hilarious. (And he hasn't changed much, check out his ""Journey to the Darkside..."")Nugent claims he didn't know the songs were about drugs... does anyone believe that for a minute?This disc is missing some notable songs, including ""Surrender To Your Kings"" and ""Inside the Outside"". Also, for no good reason, this version of ""Prodigal Man"" has been remixed, with instrumental passages out of their original order. Who would do such a thing?But this music is definitely worth hearing... the Amboy Dukes showed WAY more imagination and talent than your average 60's American garage band.",

The arranging of the music is perfect, which is sometimes hard to imagine with the amount of lyrics Peter Garret tries to ""fit"" into a melody.

The movie can't decide whether to be a Romantic Comedy, a Romantic Tragedy, a Caper movie, a Rival Brothers movie, a Character Study, or any of several other things.It ends up trying to do all these things, and doing them all badly.Throwing in quirky characters helps, but only temporarily.Ultimately, the movie lacks energy. Lacks tension. Lacks conflict. Lacks suspense. Lacks coherence.It has lots of ideas, lots of (paper-thin) plot, lots of beauty, even lots of interesting lines, but none of these work together.Pity.It is no accident that by far the most interesting character is Bang Bang--who has no lines.Without a coherent script, no movie can succeed.",

In addition, the product is set up around a theme of ""save the stars"".

"__label__2 Not For Everyone: A remarkable film, especially in the current environment of sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church. Both actors are extremely naturalistic and most convincing. Eban is not especially attractive, but he obviously is attractive psychologically to teen-age boys. This is not pedophilia, however, as Eban's father mistakenly calls him.The film may be too much for many, too harrowing for some. But it is riveting.",

"__label__2 Another classic by the masters of trip-hop: It is said that imitation is the best form of flattery. If this is true, the fact that several years after its release, the opening ""Angel"" continues to appear on Original Soundtracks should speak volumes. From the first chord, the third album by the band that brought trip-hop to us along with Portishead and Morcheeba is yet another classic. At several points, it feels like a precedent to some of the chillout acts to come in later years (remember this was released in 1998). With a tight bass sound streaming from song to song, a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all, this album lacks nothing, and raises the bar above their previous 'Protection' where the main thing I miss is the participation of Everything But The Girl's vocalist, Tracy Horn. Think no more and get it!",

"__label__2 SCARY: This mask is very realistic. I really don't know how masks are made but, looking at the way it is painted leads me to believe that it was done by hand and by a professional. I scared the crap out of my kids the other night. They got me back the next day (he, he, he...). Anyway, the mask fits fine. It's a little hard to put it on and take it off because it is narrow around the neck area. I don't think I could walk around with it on Halloween night for long though; that is because it is hard to breathe with it and because I couldn't see very well either. Nevertheless, the mask is very well made and realistic looking. If you're looking for something scary, you can't go wrong with this mask. (Four stars because of the breathing problem)",

I've little problem with this section. If you only need a C++ library reference this is a good book.The language material is quite poor in my opinion. While the book is not geared towards the beginner, finding a simple explanation of say virtual destructors is impossible. You can find virtual destructors in the index but when you turn to the page where it's listed you find it completely lacking.

These four tunes are excellent; especially the enchanting instrumental, Masquerade.

This album makes it clear that in spite of the valliant attempt at cohesiveness, individuality kills the group as a whole. Maybe the guys will realize this down the road.",

"__label__2 A Shock to the System: Well, I just read other reviews on this book - and my initial response is, why read a book that obviously isn't your cup of tea? Yes it is gory but that's this particular reader's preference. Sure it is ugly and I read to be shocked. And I was. I found it took me a little while to get into this book, hence my decision to give it 4 stars. However, once the author had grabbed my attention, she had it - I couldn't put the damn thing down! Halfway through, a major plot change happened and left me thinking ""What the heck?"" and I couldn't wait to finish it. I loved this book. I gave it to a friend of mine - and she too has the same opinion. If you want background and thorough reasoning to why killers kill - keep with true crime, if you want a great fast-paced interesting fiction story about killing, then this is it. I can't wait to read another of this author's works.",

You won't find more than general answers. Dr. Peck does tell us his success is due to his prioritizing of his spirituality. And I respect that. He refers to God as ""she"", and tells us he spends three 45 minute sessions meditating/praying most days. This is how he has become so amazingly productive in his life. It does remind me of that old saint Martin Luther who supposedly said, ""I have so much to do today. I must spend more time in prayer."" Overly wordy.",

I still have the same problem - I use it in my car driving to and from work (a 45-minute drive)...I blow it up every morning and by the time I get to work, it's flat. I blow it up in the afternoon for the drive home, and again, it's deflated by the time I get home. I've had the same problem with both of the supports I've purchased.

I can see what they where trying to do but I dont think it worked at all. Oh and this movie is not at all acurate it is based on a novel written about 2 detectives and real facts about the case and the murder are few and far between.

"__label__2 Impressive Prose Style of Budding New Novelist: I have already read the reviews of four distinguished Asian hands: Messrs Wade, Bufton, Barnes, and Hamilton so there is nothing more historically I can add that has not already been said by them.I was very favourably impressed by the Prose style of Ms Morris Wu. It reminded me a little of Marcel Proust's ""A La Recherche du Temps Perdu"". She likes to dwell on images and incidents for pages at a time. In her case she can command the reader's attention throughout. It takes a particular talent to do that and I think it is a remarkable achievement especially as it is Ms Morris Wu's first novel.I would like therefore to recommend this book for anyone interested in Taiwan history with four stars****as I want to encourage the author to continue writing, bearing in mind the comments and improvements recommended by the afore-mentioned reviewers.",

The inherent humor in the scenario of one man observing another is explored, not exploited, in an intelligent and witty fashion. I particularly enjoyed the fact that whole scenes would pass with no dialogue at all. Also noteworthy was the cinematography, which gave everything a handsome Nordic sheen.My second source of enjoyment were the reviews posted herein; it's rare to see so many good reviews so unanimous in their praise of a work, whether book, CD, or movie. I will safely assume that KITCHEN STORIES attracts viewers of only the highest caliber.",

"__label__2 A book that reflects the true nature of Russia: Most people outside Russia perceive it as a Slavic, Christian nation. That is a wrong way of looking at it. Russia is a symbiosis of Slavic/Christian and Turkic/Muslim elements. David L. Ransel's fascinating book reflects this dual nature of Russia and gives an insight into its complex inner soul. A wealth of details and astute observations make this book a pleasure to read.Most recent books about Russia concentrate on its urban aspects or on its general political or economic aspects. Unlike them, Village Mothers presents a picture of its rural life. Russia has been a largely rural, agricultural country for many centuries. Its industrialization started only a few decade ago. That's why it is important to understand the village life in Russia. David Ransel's book helps to do just that.",

Before buying this book (or even investing your time in reading it), I highly recommend that you go back and read the full text of the Times review. In light of Tepper's past literary accomplishments, the review of this book was particularly harsh, which could be distilled into a few words: poorly-crafted, badly-plotted, overbearing polemical tract",
"__label__2 Tom Verlaine's ""Cover"" is Close To Perfection: I was bewildered a few years back to find out that this incredible solo album from Television's Tom Verlaine was not available on CD. Although I could still cue up my original vinyl LP to enjoy Verlaine's superlative songwriting and his majestic guitar work on this album, I took the time to digitize the record and burn my own CD. This is an album that I wanted to be able to enjoy at home or on the road. ""Lindi-Lu"" and ""Five Miles Of You"" are two of the best songs that Verlaine has ever recorded, but there's not a bad song on the whole collection! And his vocals have never been stronger. If you like Verlaine, if you like Television--hell, if you like the electric guitar--you should own this album!",

I figure that I have walked over 25,000 miles during this time. I am 68 years old. An article about exercise and longevity at The New England Journal of Medicine got me started on such an endeavor. Plantar Fascitis (heel pain) has bothered me quite a bit lately. So much so, that I have been contemplating cutting back on my walking. Today, I received my order of these heel protectors. I put one on my left heel and I received immediate pain relief. I will keep you posted on how they work over longer term.",
"__label__1 Quality Product, But Overpriced: High quality product, very efficient detergent, however the price here is $0.27 per load versus WalMart 110 load version at $20.87 which comes out to $.21 per load with tax. Apples to apples, that equates to $13.11 per bottle at WalMart (adjusted to 64 loads), versus $17.28 here. If you are buying 4 bottles, as with this bulk purchase, the cheaper option represents a savings of $16.68 which is well worth the price of a trip to the store.",
"__label__2 Recon Scout: Great WWII Account of front line warfare: Recon Scout by Fred Salter is an excellent read! This is a first hand account by an individual that is a self-proclaimed ""maverick"" in his approach to life. He served in WWII as a scout for invasion forces in North Africa and Europe. His first-hand experiences are captured here from the perspective of the guy in the trenches, not from the perspective of a professional novel writer. He shares both the experiences, and emotions, of battle and the hardships associated with living on the battlefield in a life and death situation for extended times. A 'must read' for anyone interested in the history of warfare in general, and WWII in particular.",

THis book had the potential for a WHOLE lot more.",

In fact, the ending is taken right out of Empire Strikes Back, only instead of ""Luke, I am your father it's ""Eragon, I am your brother."" Dissapointing awaited sequal. Skip the stuff about Ellesmera if you do not wish to throw up in disgust at the love scenes between Eragon and Arya. Stupid.",

You can definitely see the very tightly woven fabric. I'm not sure what the problem is, but perhaps 800 threads/inch is too much. They almost remind me of having plastic sheets on the bed. I would have expected a very smooth satiny sheet, but they're a bit rough and loud. It's hard to slip out of bed and let your spouse sleep in without being noticed by the sound. Even after washing them several times, they're not much better. Perhaps a 400-thread-count sheet would better than these.",
"__label__1 not worth the money: While the EQ Atlas is rich in the lore and stories of Norrath, it falls well short of its intended purpose. The maps are not easy to read or follow, and the beastiary has errors. One example is in the listing for Everfrost Peaks, the atlas says monsters there are lvl 1-15. Icy Orcs and Ice Giants are found in Everfrost Peaks and are considerably higher than lvl 15. I wonder how many other zones are listed with incorrect monster levels? The bottom line is that there are zone maps available on-line that are much better than the ones you will find here.",
"__label__2 Good, could have been great: I have to agree with mis_led from Mich. - see if you can pick it up on discount. I loved seeing the show again, but the price was high for only 8 eps. Works out to about almost $6.00 (U.S.) per episode. I was not able to find the ""Hidden Messages to Leapers"" promised on the box. Also, there is a pocket for a booklet, much like the box sets of Babylon 5, but there is no booklet.The episodes them selves were fun to watch. You can see how things changed between season 1 and 2. It was funny to hear Ziggy refered to as ""he"" when in later seasons Ziggy has a female voice.The box is nice, loved the vortex look. Hope the keep that for future season.Over all, while I found it a bit lacking in the bonus', and expensive on a per ep cost, am glad I picked it up and look forward to the next set.",

"__label__2 Superior to Drinkwater in Some Respects...: This middle volume of the William Kite series is actually the first of the trilogy that I have read, but I am compelled to read the rest. This narrative is quite different than your run-of-the-mill sea fiction in that it treats a civilian's perspective of the war at sea and charts the development of the protagonist from isolated merchant skipper to a driven privateersman. It is particularly noteworthy in two respects--Kite is very much a real person and does not suffer from an incredible/implausible list of infallibly heroic traits--Kite sees the American ""patriots"" in a strikingly de-mystifying way.The book's style is influenced by Victorian writers in general. I sniffed a particularly strong dose of Dickens, which is, of course, a good thing. Highly recommended for those interested in a meaty read before the fireplace.",

I'm not too enamoured about leaving my bike outside, as I am concerned about accelerating its rusting. We'll see how this works out. Otherwise, this cover is a good value for the money, fits properly and will keep away the bad weather. Perhaps a fully zippered breathe-able fabric cover might be the best? I have not seen one. Lacking that, this one is a very good one and definitely worth the $20.",

"__label__1 SimTower: Good. SimIsle: Bad. Together: Don't Buy: SimTower first. It's an okay game, where you try and build a gigantic office tower where you can include shops, hotel rooms, and restaurants in your quest to reach Tower status (100 floors, and around 15,000 office workers). The game is fun at first, though as you move along, it gets harder to manage elevators, keep everybody happy, and still make it to Tower status (without cheat codes, that is.) Rating: 3 stars.SimIsle: I can't say much about this. That's because I never have figured out how it's supposed to be played. The help files don't help, and there's no step-by-step tutorial. Unlike other Sim games, you don't appear to be in control of much. Rating: 0.Overall: If you really want SimTower, get the SimMania pack, because at least you get 6 games (SimCity original, SimTower, SimIsle, SimSafari, Streets of SimCity, and SimCopter. SimIsle and Streets aren't worth it, but the other 4 are). Otherwise, don't buy this 2-pack.",
"__label__1 More Paranormal Than Mystery: Not a bad story, but readers should know up front that this is a book primarily about the paranormal, and not a cozy mystery as the name of the book might lead one to believe.Also, while the author obviously wants to make points about how a divorced mother needs to approach dating, the misgivings that the protagonist has toward her suitor -- while furthering the understanding that the protagonist is a woman who always puts her kids first -- has the (I hope) unintended side effect of making the reader feel like the suitor is creepy. In a book where good and evil are so clearly delineated, it's unfortunate that one of the main characters comes off as ominous and naggingly ""there's something not right about this guy.""",

When Maddie bursts into John Danhill's room and announces that he better not tell the two men chasing her that she is there. She then goes on to tell him that she got in his room because she told the clerk that she was his wife. From that point on you can't put the book down. It is a book with wonderful characters and good dialog between the characters. Maddie is quite a spitfire and he admires that about her. I also enjoyed the friendship between John and Boone. I would have given this more than 5 stars. It is a keeper on my shelf. I highly recommend it!! You won't be disappointed.,

One would think that better recording techniques and equipment were available in 1991.

This is actually my favorite Junior Brown CD, and yes, I have seen him live as well.

What is this? The beginning is good, there is a real pleasure to retrieve the women's murder club... But very soon, it's starting to go deeper and deeper into stereotypes. Very interesting aspects are left without development, the plot is as predictable as a Columbo episode, but at least the Columbo character is interesting...This book is not very bad, but I was very deceived of a such low quality after ""1st to die""... Plus the end that seems to have been written because the book had to fit inside a determined number of pages... Hey James, if you do a sequel, respect your readers: do it right!",

Don't expect great songs here, the title track might be the only real song here and its the weakest on the album - but it is a commerical overture that seems to achieve the goal of leading to the close of the album. Clearly meant to be heard start to finish, I like the trip, and music moves well, the sax and Clapton's sparse guitar rifs fill in the beauty of the picture being painted here. Reading the other reviews I realize the story that plays in my head may not be exactly what its supposed to be! Oh well! I like the roadtrip the album takes me on.",

Well I should have trusted my instincts because the unit I received was dead as a door nail. It would not take a charge at all and I was forced to send it back.

Some of it was; but, all in all, the politically correctness of the characters was exaggerated to the extreme. I am sure that somewhat similar people exist here and there, but to put them all together makes for pure fantasy.Hynes character description is detailed and very humorous. Without this I would not give even a two star rating. Also his ""one liners"" bring on a chuckle.The ending borders on the ridiculous. Perhaps it had a deeper meaning than I was able to fathom, but male and female bodies interchanging, spirits (or someone) jumping off a parapet. academics having a free for all shootout on a lonely campus, towers collapsing in a conflagration, etc., etc. How much liberty can an author take with fiction.

""Acceptable risk"" is actually a short story, that could have been perfectly told in 100 pages, enlarged with no real purpose (except maybe an editorial one) to almost 400. In the boring middle, one can forsee easily the very predictable end, which becomes even worse when the behaviour of the ""evil"" characters turns illogical, unnatural and laughable. Look for another work by Cook. This one is absolutely dissapointing and forgettable.",

Listening to it prompted my purchase of the hardcover. Reading it in print is a little different experience. Even deeper.

"__label__1 Horrible writing: This is not a story, this is an extreme right-wing diatribe against everything. According to this book the government, the police and all blue states are commie, pinko traitors who are the enemy, and the apocalypse is something to be welcomed as an opportunity to rid the world do all who don't share this author's extreme views. I love the post apocalyptic genre, but this is not it. This is a laundry list of weapons to stockpile mixed in with all kinds of bizarre justification for hating pretty much everyone. As an avid reader I could not get past the third or fourth chapter- it was hopelessly dull, and mind-numbingly doctrinaire.",

Hank would commit suicide if he could hear this today.

I wanted to read the last three pages half way through the story but didn't.

The topics can range from sleepers to major shows to legal issues. The topics are diverse and interesting. The magazine will keep you up-to-date with the hobby!Another good feature is the price guide. With each issue there is a price guide containing the retail price of many US coins. They also have graphs showing the price performance of collector coins (VF coins) and investor coins (MS-65 coins). This will show you trends in the hobby.The only thing i do not like is the advertisements. Some, not all, of the companies have bad reputations for over grading there coins. Other than that, this magazine is the best monthly coin magazine out there, and i would highly reccommed it to any fellow coin collector!",

While I haven't tried very many recipes yet, I have booked marked all the ones I want to make in the near future.

That's homework. You might want to take a closer look at the Horned God. You'll have a hard time making a vicious hell beast out of Bambie's Dad.

Better look at Lyle Lovett, he is playing, and Writing good Texas music, Being an ICON means you have to maintain a level , this album appears to be commercial, not musically new or inventive.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,

Revolting Bodies? informatively and thoughtfully considers sites of struggle over the cultural meaning of fatness and will have a special appeal to college-level health students as well as the health and fitness community with respect to its analysis of how fat creates oppression and stereotypes.,

There were elements I found interesting and one or two developments I found surprising, but character development was lacking and I found a lot of the narrative simply exhausting.The only other thing I had read of Gaiman's was Coraline, which I did like.

She not only sees really clearly, but is especially skilled at helping other people to. This book is one of my favorites that I have read by her. The other one is the one about dreams and death.

If they had, I think I would have had to quit that group. This book was shallow and did not do justice to the title of messiah. A true messiah is about much more than making random items float, having vampires materialize out of thin air, and dying a predictable and annoying death. Being a messiah is about being countercultural and addressing the injustices in the world. This book drove me up a wall and it nearly went out the window many times. The only reason I finished it was because we made a promise to finish every book before our meetings. I would have given it a zero star rating, but it didn't go that low.",

I am not often disapointed by expanded universe novels and own nearly all of them, however; this novel was a supreme disapointment. Poorly written and horrendously paced, the author showed no grasp of any of his characters (especially Obi Wan's), with many of the characters displaying the same attributes as the others. The clones were feminized, various non-sensical metaphors were reused repeatedly and the plot was implausible at best.

"__label__2 Bite sized morsels: John Piper is my favorite contemporary Christian author, so it was no surprise to me that this would be another engaging, worship inspiring work from him. His longer works such as ""The Pleasures of God"" are amazing when you have a bigger stretch of time for devotion, but this provides a perfect alternative when a larger work might put one off from even getting started. Each meditation is a bit longer than a given entry from say ""My Utmost For His Highest"" (quite possibly the quintessential daily devotional book), but still easily manageable in a single sitting.",

"__label__1 A waste of sequins: What a hapless piece of trash. ""Lady Gaga: One Sequin at a Time"" provides a rudimentary once-over of Lady Gaga's childhood and the beginning of her career, all the way to (vaguely) the release of The Fame Monster. The filmmakers essentially read her entry on the Simple English Wikipedia, and merely cloaked it in an hour of out-of-context interviews, footage of Gaga walking red carpets or getting out of cars, and some random, very angry British man. Worst of all? They couldn't afford the rights to her music, so instead they opened up GarageBand and created generic electronica tracks that sound just enough like Just Dance and Poker Face to be recognizable, but just off enough to avoid paying royalties. Around when we heard ""Ma Ma Ma Mao"" was I certain that this was the worst thing to play on my TV in a while.",

The author explains simply and clearly the phenomenon of the vow and its significance and empowerment of women and goddesses in Hinduism. the stories behind the vows are fascinating and worth reading the book just to learn about them.

I am not one to complain but this is the worse cd I have ever heard in my entire life!!! As a fellow musician I see this as a disgrace to the industry. In my opinion, either save your money or buy a good rock cd like Bush, Sublime, or Matchbox 20.",
"__label__2 The planets aligned: There will probably never be another production with this much magic involved. The time was the Berlin Wall coming down, the place was Berlin.

There could not have been a better celebration of such a historical event in time.",
__label__1 this is the worst company: yes this this is a great movie that my son has been dying to watch. I was so excited to order it that somehow I ordered 3 by accident or they sent me 3 by accident. and also I thought that reign 2 meant that it was from England not that it only plays in England. because the movie is opened I cannot send it back. and it will cost me 10 dollars to send it back when the movie only cost 5. I am very upset because they refuse to help me at all. They refuse to send me back a label so I can return the movie. What a terrible company I would not recommend buying from them at all. what are you should have to go through that and be stuck with movies that are useless to them. other companies go above and beyond they do not take care of their customers at all.,
__label__1 long range shooting techiques?: I foung the dvd to be somewhat entertaining. I felt it lacked depth in the technical area and was long in the self promotion (ego area).

__label__2 Life in Hollywood can really change someones life.: I enjoyed reading this interesting book by Evelyn Waugh. She did an excellent job on the words that she used describing the characters and their moods. At first it was sort of difficult for me to understand but then I started to catch up on what was going on.All of the characters in which Waugh created did an excellent job of making this novel start to smooth out and make it easier to understand.In my opinion Hollywood is a place where there are a lot of movie stars and tourists who go visit there and have a good time.I never heard of it being like some haunted place that many terrible things happen there such as many great people dying.I would recommend this novel to many other people out there who enjoy the type of plot that Evelyn Waugh had set it to be.I myself enjoyed it and I was thrilled to have a chance to write a report on this novel.,
"__label__2 Hori FS3 is Big Great Quality for Low Price: This was product was really worth it compared to other generic sticks i have had in the past. Though there is a Square Gate, it shouldn't be problem after u play with it for a while, but if it really bothers you then changing out the gate is pretty simple. This stick has upped my game way more than i ever thought. this stick>dpad in my opinion.Also for those who ask if this work for PC's, it does as many of my acquaintances have bought this as well, and this stick mostly plug and play on Vista 32 bits and on one Window 7 32 bit operating system.Well, in my opinion this stick is truly a great stick for bargain hunters. And better buy quick the stick went up in price pretty quick(about 12 dollars more) in 5 days.",

After reading many online reviews of different manual pumps I finally bought this one.I'm VERY impressed! On the first use I pumped 3 ounces in barely 3 minutes! The letdown feature worked nicely and once I had letdown the milk flowed into the bottle. Its compact and very quiet which I love because if I'm out noone needs know I am pumping. Taking it apart for cleaning is simply and quickOverall, I'm tickled pink that I took the plunge again and am extremely satisfied with this purchase.

I called Amazon and was told to contact the company for a key. I tried to contact the company but only get an answering machine that instructs businesses to leave a message. So disappointing, such a senseless hassle.. If I could return this I would and I'd spend the extra $40 and get a good humidor and deal with a more reputable company... but I haven't been able to, so it will sit on the shelf in my office and be a constant reminder that I am idiot for being a cheapskate.",

I will grant it is a benefit that the 18 volt has a removable battery so I can change batteries when one runs down but even when the battery is fresh, it does not blow as hard as the old model.

Since they didn't sell, REH came up with Conan and a few of Kull's tale actully were transformed into Conan stories.One of those was ""By This Axe I Rule,"" which was loosely adapted to become ""The Phoenix on the Sword,"" as I recall. Some people actually prefer the character of Kull to Conan. Regardless, Kull is a worthwhile and enjoyable read.",

One day they work fine, the next no light turns on, and it doesn't heat up anymore. How dumb I feel for buying the second one. But I figured it was cheap and surely the first one was just a fluke...

"__label__2 More O'Malley Excitement: Stephen O'Malley is a paramedic who has had enough of being a big city EMT. In a promise to his dying sister, Jennifer, he says he will leave the big city to take care of heart attacks and sprains in the slower pace of the country. On his way out of Chicago, he receives a call from Meghan, a childhood friend, who is looking for a little comfort from the rainstorm and a ride to her parents' house.The story of Stephen and Meghan's early relationship is told brilliantly in flashbacks. When the story catches up to present day, the plot twists and turns like a scenic mountain road, blending Stephen and Meghan's lives with a series of jewel thefts. This is by far the most tantalizing O'Malley mystery. Stephen's struggle with the concept of having a relationship with God adds spiritual depth to the novel.The other O'Malley novels are: The Negotiator, The Guardian, The Truth Seeker, The Protector, The Healer, The Rescuer. Each is a wonderful read!",

__label__1 They Should Have Recalled This One: Revolting. Repulsive. Turgid. Vile. Nauseating. Did I leave any perjoratives out? This is one of the most disgusting movies I've ever seen. It's nothing more than a big budget slasher movie that borders on the pornographic. How respectable actors like Jude Law and Forest Whitaker can involve themselves in such dreck is beyond me. How this project was ever greenlighted is equally unfathomable. There may have been some dark humor to be mined by the film's dubious premise but as executed here it's just unpleasant. Do yourself a favor and avoid this sadistic exercise. Poking hot needles in your eyes would be more worth your while.,

A ranking Academy member acknowledged several years ago that The Big Country received a non-digital, ""completely photochemical"" restoration for its 2008 50th anniversary debut {credit: Lincoln Spector/bayflicksdotnet}. Perhaps it is safe to assume that the restoration credit on the Blu-ray and the 2008 restoration are mostly one in the same.

"__label__1 I wish it was better: I have really gotten into Roy Wood again lately thanks to getting a CD version of MUSTARD. MAIN STREET turned out to be a great surprise that should have been released when it was originally ready. However, STARTING UP is a different kettle of fish.It is extremely dated with its 80's production, approach and sound. It was a pretty painful listening experience for me and being a big Roy Wood fan (and huge ELO/Move fan) it pains me to say that. There's not much I would want to listen to again. I have heard comparisons to McCartney's PRESS TO PLAY and the Stones' DIRTY WORK (haven't heard it), but it mostly makes me sad listening to this CD. Press to Play is not one of my favorite Macca albums, but it's great compared to this.I can only recommend this for the Roy Wood completist and even then don't say you weren't warned.",
"__label__2 Great Book, But Needs A Companion: WHEELOCK'S LATIN is clear, well-organized, and brief. There's only a few pictures and not much talk about Roman history, but for those of us who are serious about wanting to learn Ancient Latin, their absence is not sorely missed.Since the chapters are short (about 5-7 pages in most cases) the book is ideal for self-study. I would add, however, that whether studying in school or on your own, but especially this latter, the addition of a companion guide will prove to be invaluable.For this, I recommend Grote's COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO WHEELOCK'S LATIN -- a book that offers a little more repetition, fuller grammatical explanations, and is written in a calm, reassuring style. (Another plus is that it, unlike others, has its answer key printed in the back of the book -- so you don't have to wait a few months for your answer sheet if you get one at all.)",

Although this is not a sequel of a classic and does stand alone, anyone wanting to read this should read Mrs. Dalloway first to appreciate all the nuances and subtle referrences.

As for the other author, I am sure he is quite qualified at writing a guide for the one route he ""sheepherds"" clients up in the summer, but heck I could regurgitate route descriptions from other books also.

I think the lyrics to this song are BRILLIANT.Some have mentioned that the lyrics on most of the album are depressing. Well, YEAH. Don't artists write what they are feeling at times?

"__label__2 A must have for every Animorph lovers collection.: If you are looking for exitement, laughs, and thrills, this is the book for you. Even though it is not as good as other books in the series such as The Invasion or The Alien, it is still a must have for every Animorph lover. The cover may be a bit wierd-looking, but it is a great book.",
__label__2 Lovin It: I purchased this CD because I heard track 15 which is Act III the confrontation between T.I. & T.I.P. It appears to be one of those CD's that I play when I am traveling or in my F it mood. I am not the least bit disappointed. I put this CD in the player and I play it from track 1 right through to the end of the 2 bonus tracks and I hit repeat to start it all over again. My faves are:#9 Help is Coming#6 Watch What You Say#19 The Hottest#7 Hurt#18 My TypeHighly - highly recommended!,
"__label__2 WOW!: Can not beat the features at this price level. Other stores are selling for much more-thanx AMAZON. Use this scanner one time,do the work yourself,the tool is free!!",
"__label__2 Good read: Interesting book, but it seems like its written for women. It seems like women have the lower self-esteem issues, but being a male I help me a bit.",
"__label__1 I dislike this product: The product never dries, it stays sticky for hours. I have tried the ultra violet machine and blowing drying but it is still very sticky after several hours.",
"__label__1 Junk: This thing is made of cheap plastic and broke as soon as I tried to lock it in to locking device. The origianal is made a lot better, I ended up spending twice as much from ford but it didn't brake as soon as I put it in.",
"__label__2 first blu ray movie purchase: THis is my husband's favorite movie of all time. We owned it on dvd, but my husband needed to get this on blu-ray",
"__label__1 Awful Waste of Money: They made this camera sound so perfect for a small child looking for his or her 1st camera - but my 9 year old was so disappointed with this product. When the battery dies, the pictures get deleted and the controls are not suited to a young child. It is difficult to tell even when the camera is turned on or off. It is very small (too small for my sons hands) and the pictures are of a very poor quality. Save your money on this one!",
"__label__2 Woot.: What's not to love? It's compact. It's easy to read. There are footnotes that help to explain terminology. Plus, it's Machiavelli.",
"__label__1 This is NOT about rapid testing: If you have taken or have read about James Bach and Michael Bolton's Rapid Testing course, this book is NOT for you. This is the exact opposite of rapid testing and very happy I at least bought a very used, cheap copy.Very disappointed in the less than accurate title for this publication.",
__label__1 It refuses to play: Error code was the only thing that the disk would produce. I have returned the disk but still have no response from source. Thought the ability to play was a given.,
__label__2 Closer by Josh Groban: I received this item very quickly and it was in excellent condition. I would buy from this seller again.,
"__label__1 Buyer beware!: I NEVER write product reviews, but I just had to with this item. Be advised that (according to Sierra online support) you DO NOT get everything listed on the box--LandDesigner, PhotoGarden Designer and Garden Encyclopedia are the only products you'll receive software for. You WILL NOT get Designer Garden Library or Landscape Design Guide. I wrote support three times on this and the fact that I can't seem to go back to fix the windows I added to my house, and received curt, insufficient answers days after I submitted them. I'm considering sending this product back, but I haven't seen another with reviews that were much better. I'm very frustrated and wish you better luck with your software purchase.",
__label__2 still laughing: This has to be one of the funniest movies of the year. We had 6 people over (and it was a diverse crowd (male & female ages 25-55)) and everyone loved it. I don't think any of us have stopped laughing yet.,
"__label__2 Good, but not quite 5 stars: If you've seen the movie, forget all about it while you read this book. Nothings the same except a couple character names and one or two scenes. This is one of the better Vampire books around, altho the psychological aspects didn't come through as much as they did in Armor (a 5 star book which every sci-fi fan should read). The little references to Armor (Felix & Jack Crow, the Antwar bar) are cute but actually detracted from it for me",
"__label__2 Enjoyable read: I read this a while ago and enjoyed it immensely. It's a story about women who are adjusting to having or not having kids. One of the characters is referred to as ""Yoga Barbie"" because of her blonde hair and perfect body, but she is struggling with her unemployed husband. Another woman is trying to get over the loss of her own baby, who died.The most memorable character is Becky, who is probably modeled on Weiner herself - a spunky, overweight woman who meets life head-on and has an answer for everything. Becky's accounts of meeting her husband, the early days of their relationship, and their sexual problems in the beginning, are tragicomic. Her skirmishes with her mother-in-law are also entertaining and the outcome is enlightening.",
"__label__1 Awful-seems too subjective: I received this book from either my mom or my aunt who's quite religious. The authors seem very close-minded. It's a book for someone who is fanatically religious and some of the statements made in the book are a bit ridiculous, mentioning that movies like Harry Potter and Astrology is evil. Also, it's very discriminating against gays, the book gives the idea of homosexuality being unacceptable. There's also a typo on page 165 saying ""You many even feel proud of your new hairy look."" It had a few good points but overall it was so very one-sided. I didn't like it at all.",
"__label__2 Great Radio For A Portable!: For the price this is a great radio.Sony quality and performance.Sensitivity is good with the attached antenna and the syncronous detector makes SWL very enjoyable. Recommend it highly, especially to one who is starting with the hobby.",
